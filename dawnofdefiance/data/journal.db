If failed by <strong>less than 5</strong>, the character keeps their <strong>stake,</strong> if failed by <strong>less than 10</strong>, the character gives up <strong>half</strong> their <strong>stake,</strong> if failed by<strong> 10 or more</strong>, they give their entire <strong>stake</strong> to the competing character.</p>\n<p>A player with less than <strong>2,000 credits</strong> can still play however they make the <strong>check</strong> with <strong>disadvantage</strong> as it is easier for other characters to push them out of the game with high bets and on a failed <strong>check</strong> they automatically give their entire <strong>stake</strong> to the competing character.</p>\n<p>A player may come up with ways to affect their chances at winning. If they attempt to bluff, read body language or something else that would distract their opponents or give them an edge, consider giving them <strong>advantage</strong> for their next roll.

The heroes immediately fall into a profound sleep without realizing it.

Your friends are all here, and you feel fine now.</em></p>\n<p><em>Still, there is something familiar about this place . . .</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The room is an illusion, a trap devised by the <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper</strong> and created by <strong>Inquisitor Draco.</strong> As the heroes proceed through the <strong>sublevel</strong> toward the <strong>nexus of evil,</strong> they are unwittingly immersing themselves more and more fully within <strong>Rivan’s</strong> aura of influence. This is doubly true now that the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> of the <strong>Dark Lord</strong> has found a cohort in the <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> augmenting <strong>Draco’s powers</strong> significantly.</p>\n<p>Wherever this <strong>encounter</strong> plays out, the sleeping heroes discover that the room looks identical to one they’ve previously visited. If they attempt to exit the room, they stumble into another familiar area of the <strong>academy,</strong> but not one normally connected to the room they are leaving, creating a disorienting effect. You should try to create the claustrophobia of a recurring nightmare from which the heroes cannot seem to wake. To drive the point home, you can repeat descriptions of academy chambers that the heroes have visited already. Each time, preface the description with one of the following three phrases (preferably in this order):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s something’s not right here . . .</li>\n<li>There’s something familiar about this place . . .</li>\n<li>You’ve got a very bad feeling about this . . .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The longer their minds remain under <strong>Draco’s power</strong>, the more despair eats away at their confidence and motivation. For every <strong>encounter</strong> that the heroes relive in the dreamscape, their <strong>“dream persona”</strong> gains <strong>one level of</strong> <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. However, the heroes can have a maximum of three encounters in the dreamscape. During each encounter, the heroes have a chance to break free of the illusion. With their minds playing tricks on them, they need to overcome their own senses; each hero can make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> once per faux-encounter. If they succeed, they wake up, preventing <strong>Draco</strong> from further sapping their moral strength. Otherwise, after the <strong>third encounter,</strong> the heroes awaken regardless, though their <strong>exhaustion</strong> is persistent.</p>\n<p>If any hero avoids <strong>Draco’s</strong> trap entirely—that is, if a hero does not enter the room at all—she does not enter the <strong>dreamscape.</strong> Instead, she realizes that she nearly fell to a <strong>dark side</strong> trick and can see her friends lying unconscious in the room. Heroes caught in the <strong>dreamscape</strong> take note of the <strong>“missing”</strong> party members, and their interaction with them is limited.</p>\n<p>Any hero who avoided <strong>Draco’s</strong> trap sees her sleeping friends writhe and groan in mental anguish. She can’t shake them awake, but once per <strong>dreamscape</strong> encounter, she can try to communicate with them. However, her words will be distorted. The <strong>dreamer</strong> should be baffled by the gibberish, but a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong> deciphers the words. If that occurs, the hero can make the <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> to realize that he is trapped in a dream state and escape immediately. If the hero fails the <strong>saving throw</strong>, he goes on to have another déjà vu experience.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner by which the heroes awaken, immediately thereafter, they must battle a fearsome <strong>k’kayeh dreambeast</strong> that has anchored itself to the heroes and pursued them into the waking world.</p>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the <strong>k’kayeh dreambeast</strong> and its spawn, it disappears as if it never existed.

This is the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> of <strong>Darth Rivan,</strong> which provides <strong>Draco</strong> with advanced knowledge of <strong>Sith</strong> techniques throughout the fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Draco</strong> is a methodical villain. His preferred method of dealing with his enemies is to convert them to his cause, a tactic that has worked equally well on <strong>Raik</strong> and the <strong>nighthunter,</strong> and that nearly succeeded on <strong>Jedi Master Vhiin’Thorla. Draco</strong> knows that to have reached this far, the heroes must have defeated challenges that would have sundered less formidable foes.</p>\n<p>However, before Draco invites the heroes to join him, he greets them with a single word: <strong><em>“Crant?”</em></strong> This is the name of <strong>Draco’s nighthunter.</strong> It’s unlikely that the heroes will know this, so <strong>Draco</strong> elaborates:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“Crant—my companion.

If they confirm that they have killed the beast, <strong>Draco</strong> betrays no emotion, though the glint in his eye dulls. However, he immediately gathers his composure and begins his entreaty as follows:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“I am Valin Draco, and, like you, I once thought myself a hero.

Surrender yourselves—or face your destiny.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Draco’s offer is sincere. Here are some possible answers to common questions that the heroes might have for the Inquisitor:</p>\n<p><strong>Why do you serve the Empire?</strong> “<em>Beware rash judgments. The difference between an enemy and a friend is not as obvious as we’d like to think. My allegiance to the Galactic Empire is born of necessity, and you will reap the benefits if you recognize that your destiny lies with me.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>What is your view of the dark side of the Force?</strong> “<em>The dark side exists. Only the naïve and demented believe otherwise. It’s found in each of us without exception—Sith, Jedi, soldier, smuggler, noble, rogue, and romantic. I will show you how to control it so that you needn’t fear or deny it.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Why don’t you join us?</strong> “<em>I have already found my true self. I embraced my destiny when I took this Inquisitor’s garb. Now, quit this cowardly stalling, and reflect on my invitation, for this is the last time I extend it. Decide swiftly and without regret, for your choice and its effects were predetermined before these words ever obligated you to speak.</em>”</p>\n<p>It’s highly unlikely that any of the heroes will take <strong>Draco</strong> up on his offer. However, this could be an opportunity for some dramatic storytelling. Perhaps one of the players has grown bored with her character. If so, collaborate with her in secret ahead of time so that her character joins <strong>Draco’s</strong> retinue for a devastating twist, similar to <strong>Vader’s</strong> revelation of <strong>Luke’s</strong> parentage in <strong><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>In all likelihood, the heroes reject <strong>Draco’s</strong> supplication or simply <strong>attack</strong> him. Once they do, the disquieting glint in his eye returns, as if he’s foreseen their response. <strong>Draco</strong> ignites his <em>lightsaber,</em> <strong>Raik Muun</strong> takes up a protective position in front of him, and the <strong>shadow troopers</strong> prepare to snipe from their hiding spots. As soon as the heroes <strong>attack,</strong> <strong>Draco</strong> allows the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> of <strong>Darth Rivan</strong> to instruct him, teaching him some of the <strong>Dark Lord’s powers.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes managed to free <strong>Master Thorla</strong> earlier in the adventure, he arrives at the beginning of the encounter to assist the heroes in their fight. If no heroes discover the means of separating <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper</strong> from its connection to the <strong>holocron,</strong> <strong>Thorla</strong> uses the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> to grant the heroes a reprieve from the <strong>Sith holocron’s</strong> influence over <strong>Draco</strong> on his turns. <strong>Thorla</strong> has <strong>Inspiration,</strong> which he saves until the heroes reduce <strong>Draco</strong> to half his <strong>hit points</strong> or fewer. When that occurs, on his next turn, <strong>Master Thorla</strong> gains a use of the <strong>Force Suppression power</strong>, then uses it against <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper,</strong> spending the <strong>Inspiration</strong> to peel the <strong>gatekeeper</strong> from the <strong>holocron.</strong> The <strong>gatekeeper</strong> howls in rage as it is stripped from the <strong>holocron.</strong> As the faux <strong>Rivan</strong> dissipates, the <strong>holocron</strong> begins to overload, and <strong>Draco</strong> rips it from his arm and hurls it at <strong>Thorla.</strong> The <strong>holocron</strong> shatters, unbalancing <strong>Thorla</strong> and knocking him into the chasm below.</p>\n<p>If the heroes did not free <strong>Master Thorla,</strong> he does not come to the rescue. However, he might contact <strong>Force-using</strong> heroes telepathically instead. A <strong>Force-using</strong> hero in telepathic contact with <strong>Thorla</strong> can use the <strong>Jedi Master’s</strong> <strong>Force Suppression power</strong> as though they were the players. Additionally, if the <strong>Force-using</strong> hero does not think to use <strong>Inspiration</strong> with <strong>Force Suppression,</strong> the <strong>Jedi Master</strong> tells the hero to do so when <strong>Draco</strong> is below half of his <strong>hit points.</strong></p>\n<p>If <strong>Master Thorla</strong> is dead, the heroes receive none of the above benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>4 @Actor[z5vynC7RCUhQyW1p]{Shadow Troopers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[Q0V7DE7oY3TBVJde]{Raik Muun}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[5tYqNdhpDw7L64vf]{Draco}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Shadows of the Empire</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[pKAuHXri01QoMZlh]{4-09 Shadows of the Empire}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Behemoth from Below</h2>\n<p>At any point when <strong>Draco</strong> finds himself below half of his <strong>hit points,</strong> or if his <strong>apprentice</strong> and <strong>shadow troopers</strong> are dead, he retreats to a back entrance that opens into an immense cavern that is spectacularly lit by bioluminescent, multicolored lichen coating the walls. <strong>Draco</strong> retreats onto a natural rock overpass bridging a wide chasm that appears as bottomless as it is black. Even in flight, the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> still tries to push players off the ledge. But <strong>Draco</strong> is growing desperate, and his connection to <strong>Rivan</strong> weakens as his resolve does the same. He is prepared to make his last stand here as long as he deprives the heroes of the object they desire—the <strong>Qornah Holocron.</strong></p>\n<p>However, there is one factor <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> hasn’t accounted for. <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper</strong> has not been completely forthcoming with him. If the <strong>gatekeeper</strong> couldn’t retain control of <strong>Draco,</strong> he planned to summon the real <strong>k’kayeh dragon,</strong> which has grown to a massive <strong>600 feet</strong> (as big as some space slugs) since the <strong>Dark Lord</strong> first created the monster more than a <strong>thousand years ago.</strong></p>\n<p>If the <strong>gatekeeper</strong> is stripped from the <strong>holocron,</strong> his final howl of rage awakens the <strong>k’kayeh</strong> and draws it upward. If the <strong>gatekeeper</strong> is not separated from the <strong>holocron,</strong> he chooses to summon the beast at this moment. Either way, the <strong>behemoth</strong> is unleashed.</p>\n<p>When <strong>Draco</strong> flees onto the bridge formation, he threatens to destroy the <strong>Quornah Holocron,</strong> holding it out over the chasm as tendrils of <strong>Force lightning</strong> flash from his hands. Though the <strong>beast</strong> has been released, it is not completely uncontrolled. Still seething with the <strong>dark side</strong> of the <strong>Force</strong> from his tutelage under the <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper, Draco</strong> is able to control the beast—at least enough to keep it from devouring him. Likewise, he bends the massive strikes of <strong>Force lightning</strong> to his will, causing them to lash out at the heroes while he nimbly steps between them. <strong>Draco</strong> plans to destroy the heroes here, and unless they can defeat him, they will lose</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Draco's Last Stand</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[5TF86SQTcRuh4aaU]{4-10 Draco's Last Stand}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Leaving the Echoes Behind</h2>\n<p>The giant <strong>dragon</strong> causes major tremors, and the <strong>academy’s</strong> foundations, already weakened by a major bombardment and <strong>several years</strong> of misuse, start to collapse.

{"_id":"2tqHWvWpjMFZl3X0","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>The Core of Corruption</strong></em> is the sixth adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st</strong> level all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e</strong></em> experience. This adventure takes the heroes straight into the heart of the Empire and the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> They should advance to <strong>13th level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure. During the course of this adventure, the heroes pursue the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> to the Imperial capital world of <strong>Coruscant,</strong> now known as <strong>Imperial Center.</strong> While searching for the source of the project, the heroes learn the realities of life at the center of the Empire, while pursuing leads under the glare of Imperial security, the likes of which they have not encountered before. Ultimately, the heroes manage to locate the source of the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> though it may not be exactly what they expect.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>This adventure assumes that you have run your heroes through the previous <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> adventures, particularly the fifth adventure, <em><strong>The First To Strike</strong></em>. The heroes should already be acquainted with <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> and the <strong>Alderaanian</strong> starship <em><strong>Resurgence.</strong></em> The events on the planet <strong>Nizon</strong> should be fresh in their minds, since they have had little downtime since their return to the <em><strong>Resurgence.</strong></em> The heroes also should know that they returned with significant intelligence, and they should be awaiting its analysis with great interest.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t running <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, you may adapt it to your own needs. First, replace the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> with a goal integrated into your campaign. This might be a person to be saved or an object or information to be retrieved. In any case, it is something that must be found on <strong>Coruscant.</strong> It should also be something worthy of the <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> interest, since the final encounters force the heroes to take the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> head-on. If you ran the previous adventure, <em><strong>The First to Strike</strong></em>, perhaps the goal could be to find a captured character or even a player, such as a <strong>Jedi.</strong></p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that you read the entire adventure thoroughly before running it. Much of the adventure focuses on investigating the location of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and allows the heroes to move around <strong>Coruscant</strong> as needed to follow leads. Because there is no set progression between the sources they may choose to investigate, the heroes will likely jump around from encounter to encounter in <strong>@JournalEntry[s8n15L6XKq1X7hLG]{Part 2}</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>While on the planet <strong>Nizon,</strong> the heroes obtained intelligence related to the origins of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> Upon returning to the <em><strong>Resurgence,</strong></em> the data is analyzed, prompting <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> to recall them to the mission briefing room and fill them in on the details. It seems that the engineers of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> are in an Imperial facility on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> and the heroes must seek them out.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> provides the necessary codes and permissions for the heroes to enter the <strong>Coruscant</strong> system. They must slip through Imperial security undetected, secure a landing pad, and establish a base of operations. Using a multitude of skills, contacts, information gathering and scrounging, the heroes must pinpoint the location of the project’s architects and engineers. Above all, they must not attract attention from the ISB or any other Imperial organization. Their investigations may include the underworld, Imperial computer networks, <strong>Alderaanian</strong> contacts, and a little help from the <strong>Force.</strong></p>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes discover that the designers are located in an unfinished skyscraper. They must ascertain a method of entry and ascend to the highest levels of the structure. Upon locating the designers, the heroes soon realize the warped and horrific design process in place. However, before they can do much about it, the project’s true managers appear—the dreaded Imperial <strong>Inquisitors.</strong> The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> cannot afford for the project to be revealed and fight to the death if needed. When defeat seems imminent, they trigger a self-destruct, forcing the heroes to find their way out of the collapsing building. Even after they have escaped, the heroes must elude Imperial security and emergency rescue teams until they can flee the scene.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the heroes learn the details of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The Empire is constructing a massive new starship many times larger than a Star Destroyer, which is an early prototype (though not the final version) of the Super Star Destroyer. The new vessel will serve as the flagship of the Imperial fleet, and the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> nears completion.</p>\n<h1>Opening Crawl</h1>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[GEg410dDoXGGE5gL]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"uz8F6OZJn6jKsopu","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

A successful <strong>DC 15 Technology check </strong>tunes the communications array to the same frequency as the interference generated by the Felucian plant life, essentially broadcasting white noise across the entire Imperial communications spectrum.

Heroes rescuing <strong>Seejo</strong> may come to regret it initially, since the act results in <strong>mynocks</strong> infesting their ship, but the engineer’s friendship comes in handy when they visit <strong>Prakith,</strong> a place abuzz with Imperial activity.</p>\n<p>Only recently surveyed by the Empire, <strong>Prakith</strong> has a much longer history than its Imperial residents are aware of. <strong>Prakith</strong> was touched by the dark side centuries ago, when it became home to the tomb of <strong>Darth Andeddu.</strong> That fact is unknown in Imperial times, and the tomb is not discovered until the Legacy era, but its foul presence is enough to give this world of cracked and ruined surfaces a feeling of genuine dread and gloom. No doubt, this ambiance was part of what drew the Inquisitorius to locate its Citadel here. Also unknown to the Empire, <strong>Prakith</strong> has a native species—or, at least, one transplanted here long ago: the Stereb, a stoic, sturdy race of stoneworkers living in the planet’s many catacombs.</p>\n<p>More recently, the Mining Guild has sponsored a number of limited operations on <strong>Prakith,</strong> ramping them up as the Empire’s activities require ever more materials. The spaceport and military headquarters are in <strong>Prak City,</strong> atop a large plateau. <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> rises in a mountainous redoubt, more than a hundred kilometers to the west. <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are active in <strong>Prak City</strong> as well, putting <strong>Force-users</strong> in constant danger of discovery.</p>\n<p>Direct attempts to approach the <strong>Citadel</strong> are frustrated. The cover identities the heroes arrive under might provide some mobility in <strong>Prak City</strong> and the surrounding environs, but airspace is closed around the <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> mountain redoubt, and even masquerading as Imperial officers is unlikely to foil the security efforts of a group whose main talent is sniffing out <strong>Force-users.</strong> Local inquiries with miners provide some information (and the chance to proceed along a variant track), but the most promising lead comes from the discovery of <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> a member of the subterranean Stereb race who is stuck aboveground. His people’s existence here is unknown to the Empire, as is the extent of their sprawling underground network.</p>\n<p><strong>Herdr’tui</strong> directs the heroes toward a place they’ve heard nothing good about: the <strong>Drains,</strong> a collection of vertical lava tubes used as a garbage (and recalcitrant slave) disposal by the Empire. Nothing that falls down there lives for long, thanks to an omnivorous creature that must be slain or brought to heel before <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> can be returned to his people. The Stereb, heroes learn, see themselves literally as part of <strong>Prakith</strong>—as the planet’s antibodies, in a sense, keeping its arteries clear and maintaining it as best they can. They can be rallied to resist the Empire, but only if the heroes recognize this relationship and convince the Stereb that the Empire represents a literal cancer on the body of their world. The Sterebs’ best resource is information on a secret underground approach to the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius.</strong> But this knowledge is not gained easily; the heroes first must gain the Sterebs’ trust.</p>\n<p>After securing the information, the heroes have an opportunity to enter the <strong>Citadel</strong> from beneath, which is possible only because the Empire did not realize that those who constructed the ruins at its base still existed. A treacherous speeder bike flight across an underground ocean under a low ceiling infested with fear moss is required first, but the problems are only beginning. Characters must make a daring night raid into the <strong>Citadel,</strong> learning the location of <strong>Master Denia</strong> and fighting past <strong>Inquisitors</strong> on their home turf. Finally, the heroes confront the new and cybernetically improved <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> for a battle royale. An act of self-sacrifice by <strong>Master Denia</strong> forces <strong>Draco</strong> to abandon the <strong>Citadel,</strong> but at least the Empire now knows its subjects are ready and willing to fight for their freedom.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[j4VHm64VEcquBNFI]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"8VGe7GmKnpKSTMzY","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"3sLdbxlHFjhcIsiJ","name":"Discovering Denia","content":"<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Discovering Denia</h2>\n<p>One of the most critical events that happens during the heroes’ stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> is their discovery of a comatose Jedi Master named <strong>Denia</strong>. This event should occur only near the end of their stay in the <strong>palace</strong>, and most likely after the heroes have gone through the five events in <strong>Darga’s court </strong>(and perhaps obtained the <em>datacard</em> granting access to the guest quarters). Since the discovery of <strong>Denia </strong>will probably conclude the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, do not rush in introducing this event.</p>\n<p>During the Clone Wars, <strong>Denia </strong>was fighting on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong> when she was injured in an explosion. One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this <strong>palace </strong>and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the <strong>palace </strong>and left the Jedi behind. <strong>Darga</strong> moved in soon after and discovered <strong>Denia’s </strong>comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, <strong>Darga</strong> had her moved to the lowest levels of the <strong>palace </strong>and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, <strong>Denia </strong>could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.</p>\n<p>This first becomes apparent when the heroes (particularly any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes) start hearing whispers in their heads. If the heroes stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, <em><strong>“Help</strong> <strong>me,”</strong></em> and “<em><strong>I know you can hear me.”</strong></em> If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor and were given the <em>datacard</em> to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where <strong>Denia </strong>is being held.</p>\n<p>If the heroes never obtained the <em>datacard,</em> they can still reach <strong>Denia </strong>by finding a stairwell that leads down into the lower guest quarters. However, this path passes through an antechamber where some of <strong>Darga’s Gamorrean guards</strong> await. The guards tell the heroes to turn back, and if they refuse, a fight ensues.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Into the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[PyhIV17Hc6Zo8A34]{2-06 Into the Dungeons}</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>is being held in a dank, disgusting area directly beneath the guest quarters that resembles a dungeon. The chamber is in disrepair, and structural damage to the <strong>palace </strong>has allowed rainwater to leak in, giving the place a musty feel. If the heroes step out of the turbolift, they see a narrow hallway filled with pools of stagnant water, with cells off to the right. The whispers grow louder in their minds, urging them on and giving them directions to a large metal door.</p>\n<p>Pushing a button on the door causes it to creak and stutter as it slides open, revealing a chamber that resembles a dilapidated hospital room. It has the same musty smell as the outer hallway, but in this room is a large bed on which lays a woman well into her older years, connected to a variety of machines that seem to be monitoring her vital functions. A large tube of semitransparent liquid is connected to the woman intravenously, and her chest rises and falls slowly. Once inside the room, the whispers in the <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes’ minds become stronger, and the voice claims that she can feel them close to her. <strong>Denia </strong>telepathically begs the heroes to free her, though the limitations on her telepathy keep her from asking or answering any more questions</p>\n<p>Any hero can disconnect <strong>Denia </strong>from the machines that are keeping her in a coma. A hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check</strong> can bring her out of the coma gently, and she regains consciousness with <strong>4 levels of exhaustion</strong>. Otherwise, she regains consciousness with 5 levels of exhaustion and cannot move. This exhaustion cannot be removed until she receives extended medical treatment for at least a week (which she will be able to get aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> between adventures).</p>\n<p>When <strong>Denia </strong>has been brought out of her coma, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The eyes of the older woman on the bed flicker open and then seem glazed for a long moment before drawing into sharp focus.

She tells the heroes that she is a Jedi Master and that she was assigned to <strong>Plo Koon’s</strong> battle group here on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. She was engaged in a pitched battle against the Separatists when a droid starfighter crashed near her, sending her into blackness. When her mind had recovered from the damage done to her body, she found herself unable to awaken or to purge her system of the drugs that were keeping her in a coma. She has been trying to reach out for help, but the only visitor to her room has been someone who seems shrouded in darkness. She doesn’t know who this person is (in truth, it is <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the majordomo) or why he or she enters the room, but she did not attempt to make contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>asks the heroes to help her escape, since she has clearly been held prisoner for a while. She has many questions for them and wants to learn what has happened since she was knocked unconscious. If the heroes tell her honestly what has transpired since the conclusion of the Clone Wars, she senses the truth of their words and seems disheartened, but she vows to press on and escape from the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes attempt to deceive her, <strong>Denia </strong>tries to sense their true motives (her Perception score is high, even when penalized, and she has a good chance to see through their ruses), but she plays along for the time being. She is eager to leave and has no desire to stay in these dungeons any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>The heroes probably have some questions for <strong>Denia</strong>. Below are some answers to common questions:</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know anything about Darga the Hutt or the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>No, I’ve been trapped here inside my own head for too long. I’m afraid those names mean absolutely nothing to me.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>You were a Jedi; how did you escape Order 66? </strong>“<em>It wouldn’t surprise me if I was thought to have been killed in battle. It’s likely that this... Empire doesn’t even know that I exist.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Can you help us get you out of here? </strong>“<em>I will do what I can. However, I can already feel panic rising above us. I’d say that by now, they know you’ve set me free.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Can you tell us anything more about the dark presence you sensed?</strong> “<em>Only that whoever it was seemed to be afraid of me as well. I don’t know who it was, but I sense that he or she is still nearby.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[yCKIn7SvDxjfWhN8]{Jedi Master Denia}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Through the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>As soon as <strong>Denia </strong>was freed from her comatose state, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> sensed it and awoke his Hutt master. <strong>Darga</strong>, unprepared for having a full-fledged Jedi Master on the loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, ordered <strong>Demos </strong>to ready his personal starship for immediate departure and headed to the planet <strong>Bespin</strong> within <strong>minutes</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>remained behind, charged with eliminating the heroes and<strong> Master Denia </strong>as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Igren Demos</strong> is no fool, and though he tries to stop the heroes, he doubts that he can do it alone (see below for more on his plans). Many of the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> guards are mobilized, and a contingent of warriors moves toward the dungeon area to make sure the heroes do not escape with <strong>Denia</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>locks down the doors in the lower guest quarters area and the dungeon area, shutting off power to the turbolift and sealing the blast doors over the stairwell exit up to the guard room. Using a secret passage from <strong>Darga’s throne room</strong> directly to the dungeon level, the guards open the secret door in the hallway outside <strong>Denia’s </strong>chamber just as the heroes emerge.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Out of Captivity</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ifuf0JXwiJJmWe3G]{2-07 Out of Captivity}</strong></p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

When the heroes first enter the <strong>labyrinth</strong> and its surrounding cloud, they encounter the toxic atmosphere <strong>hazard</strong> (see Features of the Area).</p>\n<p>In each section of the labyrinth, each failed attempt takes <strong>6 rounds</strong> to complete, and a successful attempt takes <strong>4 rounds</strong> (assuming that nothing causes the heroes to turn back sooner).

Each <strong>round</strong> the heroes spend in the <strong>toxic atmosphere,</strong> have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution check</strong>, if a player fails hero takes <strong>[[/r 4d10[poison] # Poison damage]] damage</strong> and gains a level of <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>.

(See the map of <strong>sublevel 2</strong>. Provide the players the mini-map handout of <strong>sublevel 2</strong>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/tiles/Academy%20Sublevel%202%20Minimap.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"464\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[KVZUi9MoCQGGksEg]{04 - Handout 4 - Sublevel 2 Minimap}</p>\n<p>The heroes can issue routine commands, such as turning on the power and opening unlocked blast doors, for either <strong>sublevel,</strong> but they can do so for only one <strong>sublevel</strong> at a time. If they turn on the <strong>power,</strong> the ceiling lights flicker on in the <strong>corridor</strong> outside. However, the lights are very dim and strobe unpredictably. Be sure to describe this phenomenon to unnerve the heroes as they move about the <strong>sublevel.</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Generator Room</h2>\n<p>Halfway across the corridor, on the west side wall, are two <strong>blast doors</strong>. If the heroes turned on the power in the <strong>control room</strong>, the doors whisk open with the push of a button. If not, they need to be powered up using an external source or forced (see “<strong>Control Room</strong>,” above). Behind both doors, the rooms are of equal size, roughly<strong> 20 feet</strong> by <strong>50 feet</strong> at its largest points. The first room used to be a repair and maintenance area. Salvagers have picked it clean, but some pieces of junk are still lying around, including empty fuel containers, damaged repair tools, and all kinds of nuts, bolts, and hull plates.</p>\n<p>The second room houses the academy’s <strong>power generator</strong>, a huge cylindrical turbine. Close inspection reveals that it is damaged beyond salvation. A smaller turbine nearby is the <strong>backup generator</strong>, and it is mostly intact. It can be powered on from the computer in the <strong>control room</strong> or by connecting a <em>datapad</em> directly to it and issuing the activation commands. The <strong>backup generator </strong>has only enough juice to power one level of the academy at a time, and since the top floors no longer exist, the heroes can use it to power one of the two <strong>sublevels.</strong></p>\n<p>Once activated, the <strong>backup generator</strong> will run for <strong>six hours</strong> before shutting down for a <strong>recharge.</strong> But the heroes won’t know this, so you can surprise them with this fact once the approximate time has lapsed (or at any particularly dramatic moment). The largely empty room also has a functioning <strong>repulsor sled</strong>, which the heroes can use to haul their gear around or as a battering ram to beat down doors.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Library</h2>\n<p>The southern corridor parallels the one to the north, where the <strong>control room </strong>is located, except that it is not blocked by debris. This corridor is <strong>110 feet</strong> long. Along its left (north) wall are numerous doors that lead to more <strong>meditation rooms</strong>, and in the center of the opposite (south) wall is a single door. The heroes can ignore the doors, swing left around the outside of the <strong>meditation chambers,</strong> and go directly toward the stairwell (see “<strong>Storage Rooms</strong>,\" below). Each meditation room is <strong>10 feet</strong> by <strong>25 feet </strong>and totally empty aside from a few personal effects, now caked with dust, that were left behind in a hurry. These inexpensive items (not worth more than <strong>5 credits</strong>) might include a <em>personal groomer</em>, a planetary landscape<em> holo-mag</em>, and a <em>recording rod</em> loaded with relaxing music.</p>\n<p>The most important area of <strong>sublevel 1</strong> is the<strong> library</strong>, located directly across from the southern <strong>meditation rooms.</strong> The <strong>blast door</strong> to the <strong>library</strong> is locked, but it must be forced or powered on (see <strong>“Control Room,\"</strong> above) before a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> can bypass the lock.</p>\n<p>The <strong>library</strong> is <strong>40 foot</strong> by <strong>40 foot</strong> room. If the heroes expect to find hints about the <strong>holocron</strong> that <strong>Master Denia</strong> sent them to retrieve, they will be greatly disappointed. Half the <strong>library</strong> has been blown away by blaster fire, while the rest has fallen victim to looters, <strong>Sith cultists,</strong> Almasians, and, finally, Inquisitor <strong>Valin Draco.</strong> Draco learned the specific hidden location of the <strong>Qornah Holocron</strong> from <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper</strong> and took the ancient teaching apparatus down to the <strong>deepest sublevel.</strong></p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the <strong>Jedi library,</strong> read the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This library isn’t as large as its austere counterpart on Coruscant, but the ruination that greets you is no less dismaying. Even in dim light, you can make out a room that once was filled from floor to ceiling with shelves that housed hundreds of holobooks overflowing with Jedi wisdom. Now, the repository has been pulverized into dust by blaster fire, and the shelves rest toppled at precarious angles throughout the chamber, shattered against research stations and the marble floor. The shelves are kept company by overturned chairs and damaged computers spitting sparks. About 8 feet above you is an open second floor, where even more despoiled shelves, holobooks, and datacards lie. More bloodscrawled graffiti again attests to cultist desecration. The second floor has a catwalk that cannot be reached without a hoversled. Beneath the walkway ledge, at the eastern wall, a wooden door has been splintered open. Framing it are two bronzium busts, presumably of noble Jedi, one of them decapitated. A small plaque identifies the bust as Jedi Master Qornah. The head lies on the floor, severed in half. Oddly, the inside of the sculpture appears to have sheltered something cubical.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the heroes inspect the bust of <strong>Master Qornah,</strong> they notice a hidden compartment that is in the shape of a cube 4 inches to a side—just the right size for a <strong>Jedi holocron,</strong> as described by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. At the time of the attack on the academy, the <strong>Jedi</strong> librarian was studying the <strong>Qornah Holocron</strong> and quickly tucked it away at the first sign of danger. The <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper</strong> told <strong>Draco</strong> exactly where to find the <strong>Qornah Holocron,</strong> and the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> cleaved the bust and claimed it.</p>\n<p>The splintered east door leads into a study where older documents were held. Unlike <em>datacards,</em> flimsiplast burns easily (even more so in <strong>Almas’</strong> oxygen-rich atmosphere), so the destruction here is worse. The study also served as the analysis room, and destroyed computers sit on collapsed desks.</p>\n<p>Behind the west wall is another room, hidden behind a bookshelf, with no visible entrance. The heroes can determine the existence of the secret room by comparing the map (which combines the three rooms of the library into one large room with no walls or doors) to the size and shape of the actual room. The heroes might also notice the distance between the library door and either end of the corridor outside. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> reveals that a hidden room exists behind the west wall, but not how to gain entrance. A successful <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Insight)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Insight) check</strong> to sense surroundings with the force reveals the entrance. Otherwise, a successful<strong> DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to search the wall—coupled with a lot of patience—reveals the mechanism that activates the shelf.</p>\n<p>The door has to be powered on or forced (see “<strong>Control Room</strong>,\" above). If the door is powered on, a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (security kit) check </strong>allows the heroes to bypass the lock. Failing the <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5</strong> or more triggers a silent alarm, which alerts <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> on sublevel 2. Forcing the door automatically triggers the alarm.</p>\n<h3>Quoth of Rivan</h3>\n<p>When the heroes find a way inside the secret <strong>archive room,</strong> they stumble upon a grisly scene. Approximately a dozen corpses of different species, all in various states of decomposition, lie scattered about the room. A descending stairway is in plain view at the other end. When the heroes jury-rig the <strong>secret door,</strong> read the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the blast door whooshes open, the unmistakable odor hits you like a punch from a Barabel shockboxer: decaying flesh. Strewn before you are about twenty cadavers representing the gamut of alien anatomy and osteology, from Besalisk to Dug to Pinurquian. Judging from the death grip that the deceased have on their weapons, you surmise that two different parties met here a while ago, possibly to cut a deal or as rivals of some sort, and wound up wiping each other out.</em></p>\n<p><em>You spot the descending stairway on the other side.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This stairway leads to the archives level below and was reserved exclusively for <strong>Jedi Masters</strong>. (There was a backup stairway access farther north that was sealed up like a bunker, but it is now blocked to the heroes, anyway). To reach it, the heroes must traverse the obstacle course of corpses. A successful <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, giving <strong>advantage</strong> if they inspect the room before enter, lets them notice <strong>motion sensors </strong>along the walls in the center of the room, a failsafe installed by the Imperials. If the heroes do not notice the <strong>sensors,</strong> they automatically trip them, and the <strong>blast door</strong> comes crashing down. See the '<strong>Army of Darkness</strong>' section below if this occurs.</p>\n<p>While tiptoeing through the archive room, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>—perhaps to see what valuables or weapons the dead bodies possess—they notice a scrap of durasheet at the center of the north wall. If they try to get a closer look, read the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>A cold breeze from the opened blast door behind you whips into the repository, sweeping up the burnt ashes of ancient Jedi texts. One item stands out, however. At a cursory glance, it appears to be nothing more than a scrap of durasheet, except that it seems to glow eerily. You head over to inspect it and find that it contains a solitary passage, written in a language you don’t understand. You lift the unexpectedly heavy fragment, and among the only laser-pen burned words written in a recognizable tongue are two defiled parts of a name: DA-TH R-V-N.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The scrap is all that’s left of a tome that belonged to the <strong>Sith Lord Darth Rivan</strong>. If the heroes have <strong>SevenAy</strong> with them, the droid can translate the text. It was referred to by <strong>Rivan</strong> as “<em><strong>the creed of ruin</strong></em>” and is written in <strong>Sith. SevenAy</strong> translates as follows:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“This appears to be a dead language. Yes, definitely—the Sith tongue is such a peculiar one. The passage appears to . . . oh my. Quite a bleak extract. It reads:</em></p>\n<p><em>‘There is no passion . . . there is solely obsession.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is no knowledge. There is solely conviction.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is no purpose. There is solely will.</em></p>\n<p><em>There is nothing . . . Only me.’”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If <strong>SevenAy</strong> translates this text, a deafening rumble, like that of a giant waking from its slumber, thunders through the surviving <strong>academy</strong> structure before a violent quake throws everything into chaos. In the library outside, shelves that were still standing shatter as they crash to the floor. The archive room's blast doors slam closed, casting the room into utter darkness.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not trip the sensors or read the text, proceed to sublevel 2.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Army of Darkness</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[eP8ElABZSro29Jqd]{4-03 Jacen and the Stalfonauts}</strong></p>\n<p>After the heroes neutralize the infected corpses, they can proceed down the <strong>staircase.</strong> If some heroes were trapped outside the <strong>archive room</strong> during the <strong>encounter,</strong> the <strong>blast door</strong> becomes unlocked <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the <strong>sensors</strong> were tripped. The <strong>stairway</strong> leads to the <strong>second sublevel</strong> of the <strong>Almas Academy.</strong> Once the heroes descend the stairs, proceed to <strong>sublevel 2</strong>, below.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Storage Rooms</h2>\n<p>At the end of the corridor, past the <strong>meditation rooms</strong> and library, the heroes can turn left. At the other <strong>(north)</strong> end of this corridor, another<strong> cave-in </strong>blocks the utility <strong>staircase</strong> leading down, which the heroes might have seen on the map or learned about from <strong>SevenAy.</strong> Unfortunately, unless they want to spend a lot of time digging through the rocks (It would take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong> of hard labor), the utility staircase is not accessible. The heroes might give up or look for another way down (see <strong>“Library,\"</strong> above).</p>\n<p>Along the corridor, halfway to the utility <strong>stairway,</strong> are two <strong>blast doors.</strong> They are unlocked but need to be powered on (see <strong>“Control Room,\"</strong> above). The first room was a <strong>storage space</strong> for supplies— anything other than <strong>food</strong> that was needed by a small, self-contained community such as the <strong>Almas Academy.</strong> This room was heavily pillaged by thieves and salvagers, who left little behind but empty containers. Describe various containers of soap and torn articles of clothing.</p>\n<p>If the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>, they also notice two surprisingly light, tiny strongboxes with each strongbox is<strong> 8 cubic inches</strong> in size, can fit in the palm of most people's hands and are made of smooth, black iron. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> reveals that the containers are made of <strong>Mandalorian iron,</strong> which was believed to be impenetrable by the <strong>Force.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> beats the <strong>check</strong> by an additional <strong>5</strong>, the heroes also know that the claim is false— the iron cannot stop the <strong>Force,</strong> but the strong alloy is resistant to many types of energy. The boxes have a very strong lock, equivalent to an ultrahigh security lock and opening them requires a <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The second room is where the <strong>Jedi</strong> received and kept their food supplies. Most food has been stolen; the rest spoiled long ago. In the southwest corner of the room is a small kitchen where the residents prepared meals and processed foods. Describe some unidentifiable blackened mounds of rubbish, leftover kitchen appliances, a heating unit, a broken-down refrigeration unit, various utensils, and small spice containers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Sublevel 2</h2>\n<p>This sublevel can be reached only via the <strong>staircase</strong> in the <strong>library’s</strong> secret <strong>archive room.</strong> The other <strong>staircase</strong> down is blocked (see <strong>“Storage Rooms,”</strong> above). Upon reaching this area, the heroes immediately feel a deep unease that tempts them to turn back. <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Charisma saving throw</strong> or suffer the effects of the <strong>Curse force power </strong>when using <strong>Light-aligned force powers</strong>. The effect lasts as long as they are on this <strong>sublevel.</strong> Expending <strong>2 force points</strong> or a <strong>1st level force slot</strong> will negate this effect. Also, the <strong>Force Sight</strong> and<strong> Sense Force force powers</strong> do not function within range of the <strong>dark side</strong> nexus that has developed here due to <strong>Rivan’s</strong> lasting influence. Species that rely on the <strong>force</strong> to see such as <strong>Miraluka</strong> are unaffected by the <strong>dark side</strong> interference for the purposes of vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Encounters</strong> are labeled on the map but don’t have to be followed in the sequence presented. The encounters marked “<strong>Crazed Believers</strong>” and \"<strong>Dreambeast</strong>\" can happen in any number of rooms at your discretion. You can decide that all unused rooms are <strong>empty</strong> or <strong>permanently locked</strong>, or you can detail them as you wish (see the note block below for suggestions).</p>\n<p>&lt;&lt;Note to Jeff from Bob I can mark the map with our nifty pins if you like.

You can choose to have them empty or locked, or you can detail them as desired. Use the following as quick examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Surgical Bay:</strong> The walls are sterile white. The room reeks of bleach and, faintly, mildew. A half-dozen tables clutter the center. Optionally, a blast door leads to a smaller nursery room.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Laboratory:</strong> Here, countertops and transparisteel cabinets contain various instruments and decayed samples of vegetation (such as lichens, fungi, kaluthin, and so on).</p>\n<p><strong>Meeting Room:</strong> This room contains several chairs and a large oval table with a broken holoprojector on top. Jedi Masters held important meetings here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Weapons Room</h2>\n<p>This room was visited recently, but the <strong>blast door controls</strong> were destroyed. Opening the door requires <strong>1 hour</strong> and a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes take the time to repair the door and open it, they find something surprising: a blaster <strong>shooting range.</strong> After all, lightsaber-wielding <strong>Jedi</strong> have to practice their shooting skills, too. If the <strong>sublevel</strong> has power, several holographic targets appear when the heroes enter the room, startling them. There are representations of Gungans, Jawas, Squibs, and various small beasts.</p>\n<p>Another blast door leads to a back room. If the heroes have not restored power and unlocked the doors to <strong>sublevel 2</strong>, they must open the blast door manually (see <strong>“Control Room,\"</strong> above). If they do so, they find that the back room is an <strong>armory.</strong> Transparent plexi on the ground shields a small stream that runs along just under floor level. This room has <em>7</em> usable <em>@Compendium[sw5e.blasters.rz0YqUmRxFl79W0K]{Blaster pistols} </em>and <em>20</em> <em>@Compendium[sw5e.ammo.oeJaLYngzLX0x6Yj]{Power cells}</em>. Everything else has either been stolen or rusted beyond use.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Refresher</h2>\n<p>This is a fairly standard washroom for both men and women. It contains effluvial rinsers as well as refreshers. Along the floor runs a narrow natural stream, covered by transparent plexi.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Crazed Believers</h2>\n<p>As the heroes approach the west arch leading to the underground park, they are <strong>attacked</strong> by the first of many crazed Humans who wander this level, looking for blood. Feel free to run this encounter more than once in any of the labeled rooms.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge:</strong> The heroes must defeat the <strong>Believers cultists,</strong> who have fallen under the influence of the nearby <strong>t’salak.</strong> Most cultists have killed each other already, but the few remaining groups (as many as needed, in your judgment) wander about and <strong>attack</strong> the heroes on sight. They have been exposed to the <strong>t’salak’s</strong> touch so many times that the rage it induces is effectively a form of permanent madness.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> The heroes might try to subdue one or more <strong>Believers</strong> without killing them. They can accomplish this by <strong>grappling</strong> them and tying them up, stunning them with blasters, or rendering them <strong>unconscious.</strong> However, this doesn’t cure their madness, and as soon as they recover, the <strong>Believers</strong> will <strong>attack</strong> again. They must be alleviated of their delirium to be of any use. To do this, the heroes must make a <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to have the followers calm down. If the players provide a convincing scenario through roleplaying, give them <strong>advantage.</strong> If the <strong>Restoration force power</strong> is used, the follower's delirium is also lifted while the <strong>Calm Emotions force power</strong> will also temporarily restore their sanity.</p>\n<p><strong>Award:</strong> Alleviating the raging madness in one or more <strong>Believers</strong> provides the heroes with some information. The grateful victims negotiate their release by giving up details on the <strong>t’salak.</strong> They know where it is and what it does, but they do not know how to defeat it.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Crazed Believers</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[TlC1J9B59Rs5BoaV]{4-04 Crazed Believers}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Underground Park</h2>\n<p>All water on <strong>Almas</strong> is underground, so the <strong>academy’s Jedi</strong> custodians reasoned that building an <strong>underground park</strong> with a running stream would be in tune with the will of the <strong>Force.</strong> The stream was discovered while digging the <strong>academy</strong> foundations. Instead of diverting it, the <strong>Jedi</strong> requested that the architects integrate the stream into the design—it was they who had intruded on the water’s natural course, after all. The <strong>Jedi</strong> then planted local trees and <strong>kaluthin</strong> and created a garden around the stream. Occasionally, they took blind <strong>coboko</strong> fish out of the pond that formed in the park center, adding them to the <strong>academy</strong> menu.</p>\n<p>Of course, all the <strong>park</strong> vegetation is now dead, blackened by the intense presence of the <strong>dark side</strong>. The park also contains several bodies of <strong>Believers</strong> who managed to find the secret stairwell in the <strong>library</strong> and turned viciously on one another after encountering the <strong>t’salak.</strong> At the center of the room, beside the pool, is a large pump used to force water to the levels above. It looks like it hasn’t functioned in a long time. The heroes don’t have much time to admire the scenery, however. When they reach the park center, read the following text:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>You walk into the impressive chamber, crossing a bridge than runs over a clear and soothing stream.

Solid walls seem to have materialized out of nowhere and separated all of you, at the same time blocking the entrance from which you came. You feel a deep sense of dread when a cruel figure from your past appears right in front of you—someone you never imagined you would see again. You look around for a way out, but your feet don’t respond. You try to cry out, but the attempt yields no sound. As if in slow motion, the heartless figure prepares to attack.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This encounter is similar to <strong>Luke’s</strong> experience inside the cave on <strong>Dagobah.</strong> Each hero finds him- or herself face to face with his or her worst nightmare. The heroes are caught in a combination of a <strong>mind trick</strong> (which makes them believe that they cannot walk away or speak out) and a <strong>Force illusion</strong> (which makes them believe that they are facing an old enemy).</p>\n<p>For each hero, choose a character or creature that poses a threat and has some significance to that hero. It could be an enemy, living or dead, from a previous adventure or even from the current adventure. It could also be someone from the hero’s past (for instance, an unlikable former employer or a cruel family member). Determine the appropriate encounter for each hero in advance, without worrying about statistics.</p>\n<p>The effects of the <strong>dark side nexus</strong> permeating this place, in combination with the influence of the <strong>t’salak</strong> (which feeds on the heroes’ feelings of hate and fear), create this <strong>Force illusion</strong>. Heroes who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> realize that their enemy is an illusion, but this knowledge does not dispel the illusion. The twist is that behind each <strong>“illusion”</strong> hides one of the other heroes. The trap is designed to cause the heroes to fight each other unknowingly.</p>\n<p>Prior to the adventure, ask the players for their character sheets, and record their most important scores (<strong>weapon damage dice</strong>, <strong>attack bonuses</strong> and types, defenses, hit points, <strong>Initiative</strong> and skills, and so on). Then, when each hero faces an illusion, describe what weapons or items the opponent carries—in other words, the weapons or items used by the other hero. There is no need for an illusion to wield the same exact weapon as the hero behind it, but the weapon should resemble something in the same class (such as a vibrosword, blaster, lightsaber, and so on).</p>\n<p>If the number of heroes is uneven, one of the heroes is met by a crazed <strong>Believer</strong> instead of by another hero (for statistics, see <strong>“Crazed Believers,”).</strong> In this case, the Believer hides behind the illusion of a friend, such as <strong>Senator Organa, Master Denia</strong>, or even one of the other heroes.</p>\n<p>Explain to the heroes that they are all inexplicably isolated from one another. Ask for <strong>initiative</strong> rolls, and record the results beside each hero’s name. As soon as an <strong>attack</strong> occurs, use a player who is opposite them as a target. If the <strong>attack</strong> hits and <strong>damage</strong> is dealt, record the number. Pretend that the next <strong>initiative</strong> turn belongs to the opponent of the hero just <strong>attacked,</strong> describe the <strong>attack,</strong> and reveal the <strong>damage</strong> dealt. If one hero is fighting a <strong>Believer,</strong> this fight can be incorporated with the others in order of <strong>initiative</strong> but treated as regular combat.</p>\n<p>Allow each character a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the beginning of their turn to realize that something is not right. Success indicates that the hero can tell that what he sees before him is not real, though it looks as if it could become real at any moment. If a matched pair of heroes goes for <strong>3 consecutive rounds</strong> without <strong>attacking</strong> each other, the entire illusion is dispelled for the whole group, and the angry <strong>t’salak</strong> <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<h3>Encounter Example</h3>\n<p>Here’s an example of how this encounter could be run. Assume that the party contains five heroes, so four of the heroes fight each other, while the fifth fights a <strong>Believer.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vor’en</strong> the soldier <strong>(Init 20)</strong> versus <strong>Arani</strong> the noble <strong>(Init 14)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Kelko</strong> the scout <strong>(Init 16)</strong> versus <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> the Jedi <strong>(Init 28)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Deel</strong> the scoundrel <strong>(Init 24)</strong> versus a <strong>Believer (Init</strong> <strong>8</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Round 1</h4>\n<p><strong>Sia-Lan</strong> is up first, and she‘s face to face with <strong>Count Dooku.</strong> But <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> makes her <strong>Perception check</strong> and knows that <strong>Dooku</strong> is dead, so she realizes that the <strong>encounter</strong> must be a trick. She decides<strong> not to attack.</strong></p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Deel</strong> finds himself facing one of his friends, <strong>Kelko,</strong> who runs madly toward him. <strong>Deel</strong> asks him what is going on, but his voice is mysteriously soundless. He fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and doesn’t realize that it's a trick.</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Vor’en</strong> fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and thinks that he’s run into a <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> He pulls out a blaster and fires at the enemy, striking <strong>Arani</strong> and dealing <strong>8 points </strong>of <strong>energy</strong> <strong>damage.</strong> (From <strong>Arani’s</strong> perspective, she’s shot by an old friend, who wields a hold-out blaster that she gave him long ago.)</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Kelko</strong> (who also failed his <strong>Perception check</strong>) takes out his two vibrodaggers to <strong>attack</strong> a green, tentacled alien that he once encountered on <strong>Zlarbv IV.</strong> He slashes at it, dealing <strong>12 points</strong> of <strong>kinetic damage</strong> to <strong>Sia-Lan.</strong> (From <strong>Sia-Lan’s</strong> perspective, <strong>Count Dooku</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> her with two lightsabers. The <strong>Jedi</strong> doesn’t understand what’s happening—she was sure that the appearance of <strong>Dooku</strong> was some kind of trick!)</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Arani</strong> succeeds on her <strong>Perception check</strong> and tries to convince the phantom that she is no threat, but he doesn’t seem to hear her. She has to defend herself, so she pulls out her own blaster and shoots him, dealing <strong>12 points of energy damage.</strong> (From Vor’en’s perspective, he’s shot by the <strong>stormtrooper.)</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>Believer</strong> acts, rushing <strong>Deel</strong> and pummeling him to the ground, dealing <strong>15 points of kinetic damage.</strong> (From <strong>Deel’s</strong> perspective, he’s being <strong>attacked</strong> by his friend <strong>Kelko.</strong> Has he gone crazy? Regardless, <strong>Deel</strong> decides that he must defend himself.)</p>\n<h4>Round 2</h4>\n<p><strong>Sia-Lan</strong> can’t believe it. <strong>Count Dooku</strong> just <strong>attacked</strong> and nearly killed her. Maybe <strong>“Dooku”</strong> is a clone, a doppelganger, or something else, but whatever it is, <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> was hurt for real and must defend herself.

The heroes immediately fall into a profound sleep without realizing it. Read the following text:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As you enter the room, your vision fogs momentarily. You shake your head vigorously and feel slightly dizzy. You blink your eyes in rapid succession, then scour your surroundings suspiciously, looking for anything amiss. But everything seems normal. Your friends are all here, and you feel fine now.</em></p>\n<p><em>Still, there is something familiar about this place . . .</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The room is an illusion, a trap devised by the <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper</strong> and created by <strong>Inquisitor Draco.</strong> As the heroes proceed through the <strong>sublevel</strong> toward the <strong>nexus of evil,</strong> they are unwittingly immersing themselves more and more fully within <strong>Rivan’s</strong> aura of influence. This is doubly true now that the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> of the <strong>Dark Lord</strong> has found a cohort in the <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> augmenting <strong>Draco’s powers</strong> significantly.</p>\n<p>Wherever this <strong>encounter</strong> plays out, the sleeping heroes discover that the room looks identical to one they’ve previously visited. If they attempt to exit the room, they stumble into another familiar area of the <strong>academy,</strong> but not one normally connected to the room they are leaving, creating a disorienting effect. You should try to create the claustrophobia of a recurring nightmare from which the heroes cannot seem to wake. To drive the point home, you can repeat descriptions of academy chambers that the heroes have visited already. Each time, preface the description with one of the following three phrases (preferably in this order):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There’s something’s not right here . . .</li>\n<li>There’s something familiar about this place . . .</li>\n<li>You’ve got a very bad feeling about this . . .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The longer their minds remain under <strong>Draco’s power</strong>, the more despair eats away at their confidence and motivation. For every <strong>encounter</strong> that the heroes relive in the dreamscape, their <strong>“dream persona”</strong> gains <strong>one level of</strong> <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. However, the heroes can have a maximum of three encounters in the dreamscape. During each encounter, the heroes have a chance to break free of the illusion. With their minds playing tricks on them, they need to overcome their own senses; each hero can make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom saving throw</strong> once per faux-encounter. If they succeed, they wake up, preventing <strong>Draco</strong> from further sapping their moral strength. Otherwise, after the <strong>third encounter,</strong> the heroes awaken regardless, though their <strong>exhaustion</strong> is persistent.</p>\n<p>If any hero avoids <strong>Draco’s</strong> trap entirely—that is, if a hero does not enter the room at all—she does not enter the <strong>dreamscape.</strong> Instead, she realizes that she nearly fell to a <strong>dark side</strong> trick and can see her friends lying unconscious in the room. Heroes caught in the <strong>dreamscape</strong> take note of the <strong>“missing”</strong> party members, and their interaction with them is limited.</p>\n<p>Any hero who avoided <strong>Draco’s</strong> trap sees her sleeping friends writhe and groan in mental anguish. She can’t shake them awake, but once per <strong>dreamscape</strong> encounter, she can try to communicate with them. However, her words will be distorted. The <strong>dreamer</strong> should be baffled by the gibberish, but a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong> deciphers the words. If that occurs, the hero can make the <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> to realize that he is trapped in a dream state and escape immediately. If the hero fails the <strong>saving throw</strong>, he goes on to have another déjà vu experience.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the manner by which the heroes awaken, immediately thereafter, they must battle a fearsome <strong>k’kayeh dreambeast</strong> that has anchored itself to the heroes and pursued them into the waking world.</p>\n<p>When the heroes defeat the <strong>k’kayeh dreambeast</strong> and its spawn, it disappears as if it never existed. A true <strong>k’kayeh</strong> will make a stunning appearance at the end of the adventure, but for now, heroes can continue exploring the area.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">The Dreams Beasts Are Made Of</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[DTXBjU4W0hyb1dcL]{4-06 The Dreams Beasts Are Made Of}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Jedi Prisoner</h2>\n<p>At some point, the heroes reach the room where <strong>Master Vhiin’Thorla </strong>is held.

Instead of exhibiting hope at the sight of potential rescuers, he quickly looks away, as if to say, “Leave me alone.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This room also contains a thick plasteel table, with traces of a black substance on it and a Jedi robe sprawled across it. <strong>Master Thorla</strong> is in very bad shape, both physically and mentally. His body is emaciated, and he sports several burns and cuts. To run this dramatic encounter, you must understand the <strong>Jedi’s</strong> backstory (see the sidebar below). The heroes might suspect that the prisoner is a <strong>Jedi</strong> and decide to free him. If they interrogate him, <strong>Thorla</strong> tells them to leave him alone and that he is beyond redemption.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Universal Energy Cage</strong> was designed specifically to contain a <strong>Force-user’s powers</strong>. Prisoners in the cage can, however, use the <strong>Force</strong> at very low levels, such as casting <strong>cantrips.</strong> The cage’s functions are controlled by a handheld remote that is currently in <strong>Draco’s</strong> possession. The cage has no visible controls, and the only way to open it is to destroy it, which endangers the life of the prisoner within. The <strong>Universal Energy Cage</strong> has a <strong>damage threshold</strong> of <strong>10</strong> and <strong>55 (5d10) hit points</strong>. The cage is also built with a contact shock field, and every time the cage receives <strong>damage</strong> from an <strong>attack</strong> that deals <strong>25 damage</strong> or more, the Jedi inside receives a <strong>nonlethal shock</strong> that deals <strong>9 ([[/r 2d8[lightning] # Lightning damage]])  damage</strong>, this effect also occurs when an <strong>attack</strong> would automatically miss. When this happens, <strong>Thorla</strong> yelps in pain, but does not otherwise react.</p>\n<p>Once the <strong>Jedi</strong> is free, whether he is conscious or not, the heroes notice that his skin is charred in multiple places, showing that he has suffered many shocks. He has <strong>four levels of @Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>, which can only be removed by receiving extensive, long-term medical and psychological care. If <strong>Thorla</strong> is conscious, he does not run away or try to escape, but he won’t answer the heroes’ questions, either, wanting only to be left alone. He’s been fighting off <strong>Draco’s</strong> attempts at turning him to the <strong>dark side</strong> and has fallen into despair. Since the loss of his <strong>Padawan, Thorla</strong> has become disconsolate, and any mention of Jedi or Imperials angers him. He has an unfriendly attitude and if the heroes physically push or restrain him, he becomes violent and <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p>This encounter is a chance for heroes with investment in <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to be very useful. With some good roleplaying and a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, Thorla might be coaxed into revealing that he was a <strong>Jedi,</strong> but that he no longer has the will to go on. If the player beats a <strong>DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> instead, <strong>Thorla</strong> will become <strong>friendly</strong> and additionally answer questions about his captors. An alternative way to convince <strong>Thorla</strong> to talk is to show <strong>Thorla</strong> his <strong>Padawan’s</strong> broken <em>lightsaber</em> (if the heroes obtained it from the Squibs).</p>\n<p><strong>Thorla</strong> can provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He knows <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> and <strong>Raik Muun,</strong> and he suspects that they are inside the archives room in the southwest corner of the <strong>sublevel.</strong></li>\n<li>If asked about a <strong>holocron,</strong> he reveals that indeed the Inquisitor has one in his possession.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thorla</strong> refuses to accompany the heroes willingly. He says that all the <strong>Jedi</strong> are dead and there is no reason to go on—not with sadistic torturers like <strong>Draco</strong> running the galaxy. If told of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> says he’s never heard of her, and besides, one more <strong>Jedi</strong> won’t make any difference.</p>\n<p>In any case, when the heroes realize that the broken <strong>Jedi</strong> will not budge, they should move on. As long as the heroes leave <strong>Thorla</strong> alive, he might appear again later in the adventure.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Vhiin'Thorla, Survivor of Order 66</strong></p>\n<p>A green-skinned Twi'lek, <strong>Vhiin'Thorla</strong> studied at the <strong>Jedi Temple</strong> on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> where he befriended fellow student <strong>Devan For'deschel. Thorla</strong> eventually became a <strong>Jedi Master</strong> and a skilled duelist, participating in many missions. One of these missions changed his life.</p>\n<p>About a <strong>year before</strong> the Clone Wars sparked, he and his <strong>Padawan Kritz Drassarb</strong> were sent to investigate a band of pirates in the Mid Rim. After <strong>two months</strong>, the ruthless organization was dismantled, but at the cost of <strong>Kritz’s</strong> life. <strong>Thorla</strong> blamed himself for his student’s death and exiled himself to his homeworld of <strong>Ryloth.</strong> He sought solitude in the planet's badlands but soon found a new purpose.</p>\n<p>A<strong> few months</strong> into the Clone Wars, <strong>Master Devan</strong> sent envoys to <strong>Ryloth</strong> to invite her old friend to join her at the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> as the new <strong>Master of Lightsabers.</strong> When the envoys finally found <strong>Thorla,</strong> they discovered that he had spent the <strong>last year</strong> rescuing Twi'lek prisoners from slavers and had formed a community called the <strong>Enclave. Thorla</strong> had also taken on a new <strong>Padawan,</strong> a young Lethan Twi’lek named <strong>Dorv'Tilsta.</strong> Witnessing all the good that <strong>Master Thorla</strong> was accomplishing, the envoys respected his decision to decline <strong>Master Devan’s</strong> offer.</p>\n<p>Increasing slaver <strong>attacks</strong> forced Thorla to delay a visit to the <strong>Almas Academy.</strong> Then <strong>Order 66</strong> came. <strong>Thorla</strong> felt the death of his fellow Jedi through the <strong>Force</strong> and moved the <strong>Enclave</strong> to a more secure location, but after <strong>two long years,</strong> he risked exposure to learn more about the current state of the galaxy. Repulsed by what he discovered, he decided to investigate the fate of his old friend <strong>Devan</strong> on <strong>Almas,</strong> taking his <strong>10-year-old</strong> <strong>Padawan</strong> with him.

Assuming they have taken some steps to disguise their ship's sensor profile and I<strong>FF transponders</strong>, they can land in the docking bay without challenge thanks to the <strong>droid traffic controllers'</strong> lack of suspicion. If they took no such responses, the platform might open fire on the heroes' ship, but they can still blast their way into the docking bay in a matter of <strong>rounds.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">Once inside, the heroes know they need to seize control of the <strong>defense platform</strong> to turn its weapons on the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. First, however, they must deal with the station's defenders. Their arrival has not gone completely unnoticed, and they will face a challenging series of <strong>encounters</strong> to reach the central reactor control chamber.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">As the Gamemaster, you might find it tempting to turn the following series of <strong>encounters</strong> into little more than a linear group of challenges, offering the heroes no choice in the matter. The <strong>encounters</strong> described below are meant to be used in any order that you see fit (with one exception; see \"<strong>@JournalEntry[m9TKzJr0ByuJ9PxI]{Reactor Access Corridor}</strong>\"), although they do make some basic assumptions about the order in which most heroes will tackle them. As with the planning of the operation in <strong>@JournalEntry[tPpsJRmWJA1y2hzu]{Part 1}</strong>, give the heroes a chance to come up with their own methods for reaching the <strong>reactor.</strong> Then, each time they reach a good point, drop in one of these <strong>encounters</strong> to challenge them.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">As the heroes progress toward the <strong>central reactor chamber</strong>, take into account the following basic information about the platform.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">The Station Interior</h2>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">The <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong> orbiting <strong>Byss</strong> is designed primarily to defend and anchor the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> at the center of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Command Bridge:</strong> The primary <strong>command bridge</strong> for the <strong>Golan platform</strong> has been shut down in favor of rerouting control to an <strong>auxiliary bridge,</strong> located near the <strong>central reactor core</strong> for the whole platform. If the heroes reach the primary <strong>command bridge,</strong> they find it abandoned.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Computers: </strong>The station's <strong>main computer</strong> system and is one of the most sophisticated computers currently used by the Empire, giving any <strong>check</strong> involving the <strong>main computer</strong> of the station are made at <strong>DC 30</strong>. However, since the Empire staffs the station with droids, the central computer isn't always used to its full potential. <strong>Checks</strong> using the computers in auxiliary areas, such as corridors and nonessential locations are made at <strong>DC 25</strong> and can be used to gain access to the station's <strong>main computer.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Docking Bays:</strong> The <strong>Golan platform</strong> has three main docking bays, one of which is used for ships other than starfighters. Each of the other two bays holds a squadron of 12 TIE L/N fighters, which the heroes might have encountered already. Docking Bay 616 is the shuttle docking bay and is the one through which the heroes likely enter and exit.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Patrols:</strong> Standard security protocol for the <strong>Golan platform</strong> calls for <strong>two stormtrooper squads</strong> per patrol (using the <strong>@Actor[iI6Rulqu8TCPm4BK]{Stormtrooper Squad}</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> statblock), each commanded by an Imperial officer (using the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[QGFmgZ1B85fCp5ea]{Senior Officer}</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> statblock). The Imperial officers in these patrols carry <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.g1khCbcSlJbQ4CLZ]{Code cylinders}</em> for <strong>auxiliary computer systems</strong> (but not the <strong>main computer system</strong>).</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Security Control Rooms: </strong>Each level of the space platform has its own <strong>security control room</strong>. These control rooms remain in constant contact with the <strong>auxiliary command bridge</strong>. Each one has security control computers that count as an <strong>auxiliary system</strong>, is staffed by <strong>four Imperial officers</strong> (using the <strong>senior officer</strong> statblock), and has a <strong>stormtrooper squad</strong> (using the <strong>stormtrooper squad</strong> statblock) defending the control room.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Sensors:</strong> The sensors in the station are extremely sophisticated. When properly focused, they can detect everything from the number of beings in a room to the current health of each one. However, such focus is typically unneeded, and the droids controlling many of the station's sensors rarely perform such a sweep. Slicing the station's sensors to make them ignore the heroes requires a<strong> DC 26 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>, made from a<strong> security control room</strong>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Docking Bay 616</h2>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">The <strong>docking bay</strong> most likely used by the heroes to enter and leave the platform—<strong>Bay 616</strong>—is typically used by the Empire to rotate crewmembers on and off the platform via shuttlecraft. When <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> fleet arrived, most of the ships normally kept in this hangar (Skipray blastboats, command shuttles, and so on) either joined the fight or departed for the relative safety of the planet below. It is likely that only one ship (other than the heroes' vessel) occupies this hangar: a Republic Sienar Systems Star Courier used by <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">If the heroes made a grand show of their entrance or took no precautions against being identified by the sensors, they find a welcoming party waiting for them. For more information on this encounter, see the \"<strong>Docking Bay 616</strong>\" tactical encounter. After the heroes deal with the <strong>encounter,</strong> they can start making their way deeper into the <strong>platform.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">If the heroes were cautious and managed to sneak their ship onto the platform, they might instead find the docking bay empty. In this case, they can deal with the \"<strong>Docking Bay 616</strong>\" encounter later, when they are attempting to fight their way back to their vessel as the station crumbles around them.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>@JournalEntry[1dXnK1Pi0oQIArgf]{10-02 Docking Bay 616}</strong></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Security Corridor</h2>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">One <strong>encounter</strong> the heroes cannot avoid is the <strong>security corridor</strong> leading into the <strong>auxiliary command bridge</strong> and <strong>main reactor.</strong> The defenses in this corridor are always in place whenever the <strong>auxiliary command bridge</strong> is active (as it is now). This <strong>security corridor</strong> is the only way in or out of the <strong>auxiliary command bridge</strong>, and the heroes have a fight on their hands to reach it.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">For more information on this encounter, see the \"<strong>Reactor Access Corridor</strong>\" tactical encounter.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">@JournalEntry[m9TKzJr0ByuJ9PxI]{10-03 Reactor Access Corridor}</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">The Final Showdown</h2>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">When the heroes finally reach the <strong>auxiliary bridge</strong>, they find a familiar face awaiting them. Having seen visions of this encounter in the <strong>Force, Inquisitor Draco</strong> has allowed to the heroes to reach him, sure that his victory will end their aspirations for inspiring rebellion and earn him a spot near the top of the Empire. When the heroes first arrive at the auxiliary command bridge, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>The auxiliary command bridge is lit by the eerie red light of the main reactor. Standing near the junction between the two chambers is a sinister form of the cybernetically enhanced Inquisitor Draco, an ignited red-bladed lightsaber humming in his hand.

A pair of black-robed Imperial Shadow Guards stand just behind the Inquisitor, flanking him, lightsaber pikes at the ready.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"You're too late, my friends, too late,\" sneers Draco. \"Had I known, when our paths crossed so long ago on Almas, that you would become such a thorn in the Empire's side, I would have had the planet razed from orbit.

As you can see, I have been looking forward to this meeting for some time now.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>A large display screen on one side of room flickers to life, revealing the stern face of Admiral Varth, decked out in his resplendent Imperial admiral's uniform. \"Draco, why aren't those tractor beams offline yet?

Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:182.286px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:182.286px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:182.286px\">\n<p><em>Admiral Varth scowls at you through the video screen, the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer visible in the background behind him. \"Why couldn't you have been killed when Organa's fleet fell apart?

This makes twice that I've had to wipe out your little insurrection; how many other deaths are on your hands?\"</em></p>\n<p><em>With that, the admiral turns and speaks to someone offscreen. \"I want all available turbolasers to target the anchoring platform and fire when ready. Helm, engage the microjump. Let's end this farcical rebellion.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>The platform rocks under your feet as turbolaser bolts slam into the station. The video display cuts out abruptly, and the computer monitors show a chilling sight—the Super Star Destroyer has jumped to hyperspace, reappearing in the middle of the ongoing battle.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"font-size:14px\">With that, the heroes find themselves in a dangerous position they likely never expected. The space platform has been critically damaged by the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> but it hasn't quite been destroyed. The heroes have <strong>mere</strong> <strong>minutes</strong> to make their way to their ship before the <strong>defense platform</strong> disintegrates with them inside it.

After the events described in the boxed text below, the heroes should be at the entrance to the cavern, with <strong>Draco</strong> across the bridge, waiting for them.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the first heroes enter the cavern where this <strong>encounter</strong> takes place, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Draco makes a stand midway on the overpass traversing the black gulf. A red lightsaber hisses in his right hand, angled down and away from him, while he extends the precious holocron over the abyss in his left. Then a sound like rolling thunder causes the caverns to shudder, as if the planet itself were growling in fury. Abruptly, as if the sky’s been turned upside down, two blue bolts of lightning the size of starfighters explode toward you from below.</em></p>\n<p><em>One of the seething electrical masses smashes into the ceiling high above, producing a shower of man-sized boulders. The other mammoth blue bolt sideswipes the bridge, missing you by a mere meter.</em></p>\n<p><em>On the heels of that familiar, unnatural lightning comes a monster straight out of your nightmares—200 meters of golden sinew and obscenity, led by a gaping maw lined with teeth bigger than the tallest Wookiee. It looks identical to the dreambeast you fought earlier, and for a heartbeat you hope that you’re still dreaming. But this is real, and this leviathan makes the illusion you battled earlier look like a tame womp rat.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Inquisitor Draco</h4>\n<p><strong>Draco,</strong> now without the aid of the <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper,</strong> has gained some control over both the <strong>dreambeast</strong> and the <strong>Force lightning</strong> erupting from the abyss below. Before the <strong>encounter</strong> begins, <strong>Draco</strong> <strong>regains 20 hit points</strong> from the <strong>dark side</strong> knowledge he has retained, knowing that he’ll need them in the coming fight. Remember to include any <strong>damage, HP,</strong> or spent <strong>force points</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<p>As a <strong>bonus action,</strong> <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> can cause an arc of <strong>Force lightning</strong> to lance out at a creature, forcing it to make a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failed <strong>save,</strong> the creature takes <strong>16 ([[/r 3d10[lightning] # Lightning damage]]) damage</strong>, <strong>half</strong> on a success. Additionally, all creatures within<strong> 5 feet </strong>of the <strong>target</strong> take <strong>half</strong> the <strong>damage</strong> as well. As a result, he never uses this against targets in which he is engaged in melee.</p>\n<h4>Inquisitor Draco Tactics</h4>\n<p><strong>Draco </strong>knows that, alone, he could easily be overwhelmed by a group of heroes. As such, he takes a much more defensive position than he did in the previous <strong>encounter.</strong> He uses the ambient <strong>Force</strong> <strong>lightning</strong> to keep multiple enemies from getting too close to him each <strong>round.</strong> Similarly, he will use <strong>Choke</strong> to shut down one hero, letting the <strong>k’kayeh dragon</strong> do the <strong>attacking</strong> for him (while still shooting an arc of <strong>Force lightning).</strong> If no heroes are engaged in <strong>melee,</strong> Draco uses his action to <strong>dodge,</strong> hoping the <strong>disadvantage</strong> to <strong>attackers</strong> will prevent them from hitting him. <strong>Draco</strong> uses <strong>Saber Reflect</strong> when appropriate to deal with any <strong>attacks</strong> that get by his <strong>AC,</strong> hoping to draw one or two <strong>melee attackers</strong> to him at a time so that he can whittle them down rather than face a barrage from all of the heroes at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Draco</strong> will also begin using his <strong>Legendary Actions </strong>in this encounter.</p>\n<h4>The Dragon</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Dragon</strong> is a<strong> terrain feature</strong> with its own <strong>initiative.</strong> See below.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the heroes deal the killing blow to <strong>Draco,</strong> he drops the <strong>Qornah Holocron</strong> at his feet. With a gasp, he goes wide-eyed and tumbles from the side of the bridge into the abyss. As <strong>Draco</strong> plummets into darkness, the <strong>Force lightning</strong> stops, and the <strong>k’kayeh dragon</strong> descends into the abyss once more, presumably after the body of the <strong>Inquisitor.</strong> With <strong>Draco</strong> defeated and the <strong>holocron</strong> recovered, the heroes need to escape from the collapsing <strong>academy</strong> with haste.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note from Foundry Converters:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> It's important that Draco falls into the abyss with no body to recover if you wish to continue the campaign as written. He has an ongoing role to play, starting in the next adventure. If the party finds a way to permanently kill them, it's up to the Gamemaster to deal with that at their table.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/4/4-10_dracos_last_stand_dragon.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>Two environmental features make this <strong>encounter</strong> challenging for the heroes. First, most of the <strong>combat</strong> will take place on a large stone bridge with no railings. Any heroes pushed off of the bridge must attempt to catch themselves or they will fall into the abyss.</p>\n<p>Second, the <strong>k’kayeh dragon</strong> stretches up to menace the heroes. Though the <strong>dragon</strong> would normally be far too powerful for them to face, in this encounter, it acts more like an obstacle than a true opponent. The dragon has an <strong>Initiative bonus</strong> of <strong>+6</strong> and an <strong>AC</strong> of <strong>18.</strong> If successfully hit by a ranged <strong>attack,</strong> the beast takes a cumulative <strong>1d4 penalty</strong> to its bite <strong>attack</strong> for each <strong>ranged</strong> <strong>attack</strong> that hits it. (You should make it clear to the heroes that their combined efforts are having a combined effect, giving <strong>ranged attackers</strong> a role in the encounter while melee combatants deal with Draco.) Once per <strong>round,</strong> the dragon snaps at any heroes in the chamber who are not engaged in melee with <strong>Draco,</strong> making a melee weapon <strong>attack</strong> with a <strong>+8 attack bonus ([[/r 1d20+8 # K'kayeh Dragon]])</strong>. A successful hit deals <strong>16 ([[/r 2d8+7[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> to the target and moves the target<strong> 5 feet</strong> in any direction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"K1Qo6BYMT0OJLItP","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Between you and Nizon, emerging from the dust cloud that surrounds the world, is a Star Destroyer! It’s an older, smaller model than the new Imperial class that the Empire is producing, but it’s still a fully functional capital ship, with an escort of V-wing fighters. Having just escorted a Gallofree Yards Medium Transport out of Nizon’s orbit, the Star Destroyer turns and heads toward you. The Imperial ship makes no effort to communicate with you, and its approach is direct—and hostile.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>The Arkanian Dragon</h4>\n<p>A Victory II-class Star Destroyer, the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> controls access to space around <strong>Nizon.</strong> It is currently escorting a transport ship (similar to the slave ship from <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>) out of the planet’s orbit, at which point the transport jumps into hyperspace. The heroes’ ship has no cover and no business being in the <strong>Centares System,</strong> so the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> immediately orders them to stop and prepare to be boarded. Presumably, the heroes refuse.</p>\n<p>This is likely the first time that the heroes have had to confront a Star Destroyer directly, so you should warn them of the danger of trying to defeat such a ship. It’s also important for them to learn that the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> can’t land or operate in the atmosphere of <strong>Nizon.</strong> It’s bound to the reaches of space, so if the heroes can get past the ship and through the dust cloud that surrounds the planet, they can escape its attentions. Doing so, however, requires the heroes to fight their way past the Star Destroyer and its complement of starfighters.</p>\n<p>Sixteen of the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon’s</em></strong> <strong>V-wing</strong> fighters are deployed elsewhere around <strong>Nizon,</strong> out of range of this battle. Of the remaining <strong>eight,</strong> the captain of the Star Destroyer opts to keep <strong>four</strong> in reserve (in case the heroes are just a diversion) and sends <strong>four</strong> out after the heroes.</p>\n<h4>The Arkanian Dragon Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> is only truly afraid of capital ships and will attempt to engage the player's ships without hesitation though if it feels threatened by the players sufficiently, it will deploy the remaining<strong> 4 V-wings</strong> to save itself. The <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> cannot operate in atmosphere or land on the ground so if the players manage to get through the dust cloud, it will be forced to stop chasing them.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[GH4pTUU2IDzFuuOb]{\"The Arkanian Dragon\" Victory-II Class Star Destroyer}</strong></p>\n<h4>V-Wing</h4>\n<p><strong>4 @Actor[bul3Eb90zbCc73Ih]{V-Wing Starfighters}</strong></p>\n<h4>V-Wings Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>V-wings</strong> will attempt to push the players towards the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> and prevent them from entering the dust cloud and escaping. The <strong>V-wings</strong> are also receiving tracking information from the sueface below meaning that they do not have to make <strong>checks</strong> to navigate the dust cloud but it is still <strong>difficult terrain.</strong> If the players manage to escape the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> the <strong>V-wings</strong> break off and return to it, unwilling to continue without support or risk the safety of their parent ship on what could possibly be a diversion.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>There are three possible outcomes. In the event the players manage to escape the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> and its escort, they are not chased further and can see there is only one major city anywhere on the surface and plenty of places to hide their ship.</p>\n<p>Although unlikely, it’s possible that the heroes—through great skill, great luck, or more firepower than the adventure is designed for—destroy the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> and enough of its escorts to take control of the star system. If this happens, you as the GM have two basic options. First, you can run the adventure as written, but allow the PCs to use their starship as a weapon during the riots on <strong>Nizon.</strong> They can’t bypass certain encounters (for example, finding <strong>Sartok</strong> is possible only on foot, and the Imperial ground troops don’t evaporate just because their support ship is gone), but a functioning starship makes other encounters (such as the <strong>@JournalEntry[hooa0Z0uGbbvQcGK]{Battle for Martyr's Plaza}Battle for Martyr’s Plaza)</strong> much less challenging.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can have Imperial reinforcements arrive within a few hours of the <strong>Dragon’s</strong> destruction. The Empire has been regularly moving material between a nearby industrial world and <strong>Nizon,</strong> and a missed hourly status check from the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> can bring more Star Destroyers to secure the system. These starships can be as heavy and as numerous as you need to prevent the heroes from feeling confident enough to fly their ship around during the rioting. A Venator class Star Destroyer and its escorts should be more than enough to get the most hardened aces to land and keep their ship under cover until the planet is secured (especially since they are unlikely to have defeated the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> without suffering serious damage). Once the <strong>control center</strong> has been captured and the planet is in <strong>Nazren</strong> hands, any remaining Imperial space forces evacuate to carry word of the defeat back to Coruscant.</p>\n<p>The third and final outcome is the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> defeats the heroes. This adventure changes very little. If the heroes’ ship is destroyed, inform the players that they have been shot down and crash outside a large city, and proceed with the adventure normally. If the heroes are captured, the <strong><em>Dragon’s</em> captain</strong> informs them that a bounty hunter is looking for them, and the Empire is inclined to turn them over. The heroes are placed in a <strong>detention camp,</strong> where <strong>Sartok</strong> finds and rescues them before asking for their help to free his world.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Approaching%20Nizon.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Areas</strong></p>\n<p>The space around <strong>Nizon</strong> is filled with a thick cloud of dust and rogue asteroid fragments that can do serious damage to a starship with very little warning, filling a <strong>2000 foot area</strong> between the atmosphere of the planet and the Star Destroyer.</p>\n<p>The cloud is considered difficult terrain and ships entering the cloud for the first time on their turn or ending their turn in the cloud must make a <strong>DC 16 Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> to avoid hitting a rogue fragment and taking damage.

Unless the heroes managed to stop all of the Imperials in the facility from sounding an alarm (a difficult prospect, given the layout of the detention block), <strong>Vischera </strong>is waiting for them to arrive, attended by two bodyguards—mutated <strong>Felucians </strong>that have been molded into terrifying fighting machines. See “Command Center” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<p>When the heroes reach the command center, their primary goal should be getting to the <strong>roof</strong>. They can do so via two large platforms that rise up through hatches in the roof, allowing the Imperials to load and unload cargo.

Also, construction repulsorlift platforms on level 185 provide access to the incomplete areas of <strong>levels 186</strong> to <strong>189.</strong> The platforms do not respond to <strong>Dos’s</strong> <strong>code cylinder</strong>, but they will respond to a construction <strong>code cylinder</strong> or may be hotwired to override their security protocols with a <strong>DC 24 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Inside the Spire</h2>\n<p>As long as the building is not in a state of alert, the heroes are free to move about the tower using functioning turbolifts, partially completed stairs, and construction repulsorlift platforms. If the alarm is raised, the turbolifts are locked down, forcing the heroes to take other paths between floors. However, <strong>Agent Dos’s control cylinder </strong>overrides the turbolift lockdown. There is plenty of construction equipment, cutting torches, and lasers scattered around the building to provide cover and conceal movement. The construction workers and droids will report any suspicious activity they see and flee the area if threatened.</p>\n<h3>Level 188</h3>\n<p><strong>Level 188</strong> is only partially completed. It may be accessed by stairwell, turbolift, or construction lift from the level below. Once the heroes reach the completed section of the level, they ultimately have to force their way in, and when that happens, events move at a rapid pace.</p>\n<p>See <strong>encounters:</strong></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ZpNzdIWxT9gjhQ2l]{6-10 Level 188 Entry}</p>\n<p>and:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[h1j5UgAFUNNNsxDe]{6-11 Level 188 Detention Block}</p>\n<p>After the <strong>encounters,</strong> the heroes discover the surprising truth about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The <strong>detention block</strong> holds five Humans, two Duros, and one Mon Calamari, in several cells. All <strong>prisoners</strong> are desperate to escape their rooms, but all except one <strong>Duros</strong> are delusional. That <strong>Duros</strong> is in better condition and can answer the heroes’ questions.</p>\n<p>Read or paraphrase the following. If the heroes appear to be Imperials at first glance, the <strong>Duros</strong> will cower, and the heroes will have to convince the <strong>prisoner</strong> that they are not part of some Imperial trick.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As you enter the dimly lit metal cell, a beaten and depressed Duros slowly raises his head from the cold metal slab that serves as a bed. It takes a moment for him to focus, but when he realizes that you are not a guard or Imperial, he immediately jumps to his feet. “Please, you must get me out of here. They are monsters without pity or compassion. I surely won’t last another week here. We must escape before they return to deal with you . . . and us.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The <strong>Duros</strong> is named <strong>Gelnar Tol</strong>, a starship designer who used to work for Kuat before being abducted and brought here <strong>about a week ago</strong>. He is willing and able to tell the heroes what he knows about the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> (although he doesn’t know the project codename or the names of the other designers). This is the heart of the design team for a massive new starship some <strong>7.5 miles</strong> long that will dwarf even an Imperial class Star Destroyer (and is a forerunner of the eventual Super Star Destroyer). However, the project is operating in a manner beyond belief. The designers are held <strong>prisoner</strong> by the <strong>Inquisitors,</strong> who use “<strong>what must be evil dark side powers</strong>” to rip data from the designers’ minds or to turn them into single-minded machines that work on command, unaware of anything else. <strong>Gelnar Tol</strong> has no idea why the Empire would design a starship in this manner, but he is desperate to escape.</p>\n<p>@Actor[g2nwFfegLrJ1pZRS]{Prisoner}</p>\n<p>By accessing the detention area computers and making a <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> which cannot be reduced by <strong>code cylinders</strong> as the other systems. On a successful <strong>check,</strong> the heroes discover that the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are transmitting the design data through <strong>CZ-3T6</strong> and the communications node on <strong>level 187</strong>. The information goes to messenger drones and other outlets that pass it on to an unknown construction site.</p>\n<p>With another <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>, they discover that the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> is the codename for the massive ship, which will serve as the flagship for the new Imperial fleet, as well as a prototype for future vessels. The Empire plans to use it as a weapon of terror and massive mobile weapons platform. The Imperial Navy and the Inquisitorius are working together to secretly build the ship without alerting the <strong>Imperial Senate,</strong> which would never approve of such a risky design. The project is strictly off the books, so construction supplies are purchased through alternative means (such as the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> bought from <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>). They are also using <strong>Nazren</strong> <strong>slaves</strong> to build the ship. The files include detailed data on the transactions, which would be useful to <strong>Senator Organa.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes do not have time to <strong>check</strong> the computer system or are unable to access it, a <strong>DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> will reveal that they could simply take the storage array from the control panels in either interrogation room with them and attempt to slice it later. The array is about the size of a small backpack and weighs <strong>7 pounds</strong>. It can be removed from the system with a <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Inquisitor Arrival</h3>\n<p>The heroes have only about <strong>15 minutes</strong> after the end of the <strong>level 188 encounters</strong> before reinforcements arrive in a big way. When the heroes are ready to leave, they discover that the doors out of <strong>level 188</strong> are locked down and their code cylinder has been locked out. They can tell from the security screens in the <strong>control room</strong> that <strong>Coruscant Guards</strong> are blocking the stairwell and that the lift has been locked on another floor. They also realize that all of the construction workers are evacuating the structure by whatever means they can. The only way out is to break through the door to the incomplete area. They may physically break through the door with a <strong>DC 20 Strength check</strong> or attempt to open it with a <strong>DC 21 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. If the heroes dally, prod them along by having the computers indicate that many <strong>Coruscant Guards</strong> are advancing up the stairwells. However, the guards are only there to keep the heroes from escaping. The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are coming to take care of the problem personally.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[m9iwBNKJF24XMsPZ]{6-12 Inquisitor Attack}</p>\n<h3>Collapse and Descent</h3>\n<p>Just as the last <strong>Inquisitor</strong> is about to be defeated, he triggers the building’s self-destruct sequence via <strong>comlink,</strong> which immediately activates. The fact that the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> will go to such an extreme to prevent the project’s discovery should inspire awe and fear in the heroes. However, they have no time to discuss it because the building immediately begins to collapse, and they are in no position to escape. It is readily apparent that they will not make it back to their speeder or out of the building in time. Even though it looks hopeless, all is not yet lost.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ovI2tx2LlNHYO3Pa]{6-13 Collapse and Descent}</p>\n<h2>Escape</h2>\n<p>With the collapse of the <strong>Spire,</strong> the entire area becomes a chaotic disaster area. Though the building largely collapsed into the <strong>sublevels,</strong> much debris has fallen into the <strong>Crystalline Plaza,</strong> shattering the sculptures and spreading crystal shards across the area. Fortunately, the evacuation of the construction workers and the irregular collapse prevented a greater loss of life. Emergency services and security personnel descend within <strong>10 minutes</strong> and begin to search for survivors. If any of the heroes are trapped in a prefabricated room or within the rubble, emergency personnel may dig them out. Otherwise, they must escape the rubble on their own, and once on the <strong>“ground,”</strong> the heroes must elude Imperial investigators seeking to apprehend them and emergency workers looking to render aid. They must elude at least<strong> two Coruscant trooper</strong> patrols and at least <strong>three aid worker</strong> attempts to provide assistance and take down their information. This requires several <strong>Charisma (Deception) checks</strong>, <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong>, and/or <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) checks</strong>. Fortunately for the heroes, all the chaos provides ample cover for slipping through the rubble and finding a way out. The heroes may escape the area by commandeering an emergency vehicle or ambulance or through some other method. This provides noncombat characters, leaders, and nobles another chance to talk their way out.</p>\n<p>Not all of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> designers are accounted for. <strong>Gelnar Tol</strong> may or may not have escaped with the heroes, but it is certain that some of the designers were killed in the collapse, while others either escaped or were buried in the rubble. It is impossible for the heroes to discover their fate. The last Inquisitor may or may not be accounted for.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The heroes are likely to be reluctant to return to their hotel or ship, as they rightfully suspect that the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> have identified them. Eventually, they should contact <strong>Tero Reskan</strong>, who is relieved to discover that they are still alive and quickly comes to pick them up in an airspeeder. He takes them to a safehouse that he uses as a headquarters deep in the warehouses of the <strong>Works,</strong> far away from <strong>CoCo Town.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tero</strong> offers to get word back to <strong>Senator Organa</strong> and even transmit the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> data back to the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> using a pirated Holo-net feed. The heroes are congratulated on their efforts and ordered to stay out of sight and in hiding on <strong>Coruscant</strong> until <strong>Captain Verana</strong> and <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> determine the next course of action.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> finishing the adventure</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"uz8F6OZJn6jKsopu","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

He has been a member of the Imperial military machine since it was formed, and he served the Republic prior to that. He proved himself capable of becoming a <strong>Death Trooper.</strong> Though the requirements and responsibilities are rigorous, the work is rewarding, and <strong>Kar’eme</strong> sees that the work he does has an effect on ensuring the stability of the Empire.</p>\n<p>Unless viewed through a <strong>Death Trooper</strong> helmet, <strong>Kar’eme</strong> looks no different than the other troopers in his team.

She has made a <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) check </strong>to hide here. The four Neimoidian <strong>kreehawks </strong>sit to either side of the winding path, perched up in the trees.

She is not very stealthy, but she tries to hide at the beginning of the encounter. Her first action is to call in the <strong>kreehawks </strong>(by blowing a whistle, which signals them to <strong>attack</strong>), and if she can remain hidden, she does. If forced to fight, or if the <strong>kreehawks </strong>are all taken down, <strong>Kessra </strong>emerges and attempts to kill the heroes with her heavy blaster pistol.</p>\n<h4>Neimoidian Keehawks</h4>\n<p>The Neimoidian <strong>kreehawk </strong>is a large avian creature with razor-sharp talons that is native to the forests of <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. Each of these birds has the potential to reach great speeds and is extremely nimble. Neimoidian <strong>kreehawks </strong>have black feathers and large, reflective eyes that allow them to see even in near darkness. <strong>Darga </strong>keeps four of these creatures in his <strong>aviary,</strong> and sometimes when he needs to dispose of an unruly associate, he has that person sent here, where the <strong>kreehawks </strong>eliminate the victim—and devour the remains.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This large black bird has a smooth, sloping head and reflective eyes, its black-feathered body looming large in the darkness.

If they take her to <strong>Darga</strong>, he has the <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> in his audience chamber drag her off to the dungeons, placing her in a cell but hardly giving her a second thought. More than anything else, <strong>Darga </strong>is disappointed that he didn’t get to see the fight.

Gome</strong> has been working for the crime lord for decades now, ever since <strong>Darga</strong> first rose to power, and he is exceptionally good at his job. Unlike others who have benefited from <strong>Darga’s </strong>wealth, <strong>Gome</strong> is mostly indifferent about his work. He seems to have no emotional investment in <strong>Darga’s </strong>crime syndicate and is puzzled by the idea that someone might try to meddle in the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> resides in a small apartment just off of the guest quarters, which serves as both his home and his workspace. The Duros has little daily contact with anyone other than the servants who bring him food and drink, so when the heroes show up at his door, he is more than a bit surprised. (The heroes might be drawn to his apartment by the <strong>loud Neimoidian opera </strong>echoing from behind the door, or because they saw a <strong>Gamorrean guard</strong> from <strong>Darga’s court </strong>bring a transparent bag full of <em>credit sticks</em> to <strong>Gome’s</strong> room.)</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: Gome</strong> presents a good opportunity for the heroes to learn more about <strong>Darga’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> particularly the nature of what he trades to the Empire. Though <strong>Gome</strong> is surprised to see the heroes, his attitude begins as <strong>indifferent</strong> toward them. If the heroes shift his attitude to friendly through a <strong>DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he is happy to discuss all manner of secrets with them—at least, the ones he knows about. <strong>Gome</strong> is older and probably nearing the end of his days, so he tends to ramble and get distracted. The heroes will need to keep him on track if they are to learn anything from him, so you should portray him as absent-minded to encourage the heroes to steer him back to their conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> knows the following: At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, <strong>Darga</strong> took over a Tibanna gas smuggling ring after its leader was slain by Separatist mercenaries. Since that time, he has managed to increase the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> that is being smuggled away from its normal channels, and the smuggling ring has proven to be his most profitable venture, even ahead of his slave trading. The Empire approached <strong>Darga</strong> a few months ago with an interest in obtaining some of his <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> supplies off the record—though <strong>Gome</strong> recalls that they threatened to bring down the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> crime syndicate if he didn’t play nicely. Since then, <strong>Darga </strong>has been funneling every canister of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to the Empire for a secret project. The gas, which is refined on the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> is loaded into large starships and handed over to the Empire in the space above that world. In return, <strong>Darga </strong>receives some kind of goods <strong>(Gome</strong> does not know what), and their transaction is ended. The exchange takes place quickly and seems private because few people even know that Bespin exists; it’s too small to have an Imperial presence. <strong>Darga</strong> has made a handsome profit from the arrangement, and he maintains a remote headquarters in Cloud City, where he can personally oversee the transactions and enjoy the amenities of the floating city.</p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":-50000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Lesan Dos</strong> to the <strong>Outlander Club</strong> (where <strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong> and <strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong> tracked down <strong>Zam Wesell</strong> in <em><strong>Episode II</strong></em>). The <strong>Outlander</strong> is one of many vibrant <strong>lower-level</strong> clubs in the entertainment district. The heroes have little to go on other than the fact that <strong>Dos</strong> is carrying out some sort of investigation at the club. This may strike them as odd, since his anti-alien stance would seem to make it nearly impossible to carry out any secret investigation.</p>\n<p>The heroes should get to the club via airspeeder, preferably one they own or control. They may find parking places on an adjacent street (see @JournalEntry[NaCAfYeI8kmmMygm]{6-05 Imperial Pursuit, Part 1}). When the heroes arrive at the club, they find security keeps a close watch on all doors, and they are encouraged to use the main entrance.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the heroes enter the <strong>Outlander,</strong> read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The neon framed entrance to the glitzy Outlander Club gives way to a huge multistory circular room, packed with beings from across the galaxy.

Huge viewscreens at the perimeter walls show racing and sporting events of dubious legality. Signs indicate that gambling halls and other entertainments are available on the balcony levels above. Five circular turbolifts and adjacent one-person lifts in clear tubes give access to other floors. The place is well lit, loud, crowded, and lively.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Once inside, allow the heroes to make <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong>. A result of <strong>15</strong> <strong>or above</strong> quickly indicates the variety of legal and illegal entertainment available. A result of <strong>20 or above</strong> allows them to spot someone who looks like<strong> Lt. Dos</strong>, dressed in bright blue civilian clothing, standing at a tall table near the video screens. It’s actually <strong>Nonul Weran,</strong> the lieutenant’s double and decoy. <strong>Lt. Dos</strong> is staging a sting operation, trying to draw his non-Human enemies out in the open so he can arrest or eliminate them. As an ISB agent, his presence is not normally tolerated at the club, but he is blackmailing the owners to allow him to carry out his operation. Someday, he hopes to shut the place down, but for now, he uses it for his own schemes. However, he knows that he can’t rely on the club’s security to back him up, so he usually tries to get the attackers outside so he can call in superior numbers.</p>\n<p>The operation has been underway for some time, with limited success. <strong>Nonul</strong> plays the part of <strong>Dos,</strong> having a good time in the club, while the agent, disguised in a breath mask and a worker’s jumpsuit, observes from a balcony above.</p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t spot the decoy right away, they may continue to make <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks </strong>while they search the room. Once they approach the decoy, read his text aloud. When the heroes get within <strong>10 feet</strong> of <strong>Nonul,</strong> let them make an additional <strong>Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A result of <strong>15 or higher</strong> allows them to notice that he is following three different swoop races on the viewscreens and glancing at his gambling <em>datapad.</em> A result of <strong>20 or higher</strong> shows the heroes the location of his <strong>two informants</strong> that are his immediate backup. A result of <strong>25 or higher</strong> also tips them off that this may not be <strong>Dos</strong> but someone made up to look like him. Grant the heroes <strong>advantage</strong> on the <strong>Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> if they have more than the newsnet picture of <strong>Dos</strong> to go on.</p>\n<h4>Nonul Weran</h4>\n<p><strong>Nonul Weran</strong> is an ISB undercover specialist that <strong>Dos</strong> has manipulated into serving as his double and decoy for this operation. <strong>Nonul</strong> is comfortable at the <strong>Outlander,</strong> but on his guard. He’s been attacked entering, leaving, and occasionally even within the club. He mimics <strong>Dos</strong> reasonably well, though he’s not quite as arrogant.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>You approach a young adult Human, dressed in a trendy bright blue jumpsuit with white trim.

If the heroes attempt to sneak up on him, let him make <strong>Perception checks</strong>. If they engage him in conversation, he responds arrogantly and goes on about racing until he’s sure they’re really after him. If they directly ask his identity, he claims to be <strong>Lt. Dos</strong>. Use <strong>Nonul's Charisma (Deception)</strong> and player's <strong>Wisdom (Insight)</strong> to guide the conversation. <strong>Nonul</strong> knows that his only backup is two informants and <strong>Dos</strong> himself. He goes along with almost any scheme that doesn’t directly threaten him so that he can get the heroes in a position where <strong>Dos,</strong> the <strong>informants,</strong> and possibly other backup can arrest them outside of the club. He even leads them out, if needed. If forced to fight, he relies on his <em>blaster,</em> attempting to surprise the heroes with a quick draw. He knows nothing about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nonul Weran</strong> has <strong>500 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>ISB Outlander Informant</h4>\n<p><strong>Two</strong> of <strong>Lt. Dos’s</strong> most reliable <strong>informants</strong> mingle with the crowd near the <strong>decoy.</strong> They gather additional information that might be useful to the <strong>lieutenant</strong> and provide backup for <strong>Dos</strong> and his <strong>decoy.</strong> One is <strong>male,</strong> the other <strong>female.</strong> If they are detected by the heroes, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>You see a young man (woman) leaning against a nearby table, toying with a glass of hazy orange liquid.

If the heroes approach the <strong>decoy,</strong> they begin to move closer, taking up positions at nearby tables in case the <strong>decoy</strong> needs help. If forced to fight, they rely heavily on their <strong>sneak attack</strong>. If questioned, they have little to offer beyond the basics of <strong>Dos’s</strong> sting operation, and they know nothing about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p>Each informant has <strong>500 credits</strong> for a total of <strong>1000 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>Lesan Dos</h4>\n<p><strong>Lt. Dos</strong> hides in plain sight behind his <em>breath mask</em> and worn, rumpled jumpsuit. Built into the mask is a <em>commlink</em> tuned to the decoy’s <em>commlink,</em> through which <strong>Dos</strong> can hear all conversations with <strong>Nonul.</strong> He can even issue brief orders to <strong>Nonul</strong> and the <strong>informants,</strong> if needed. <strong>Dos</strong> is sneaky but arrogant and overconfident. If the heroes look at him with interest, not just in passing, read or paraphrase the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>You see a young humanoid male in a worn and rumpled jumpsuit common to workers throughout the lower levels.

Lesan Dos}</strong></p>\n<h4>Lesan Dos Tactics</h4>\n<p><strong>Lt. Dos</strong> will direct and manipulate the situation once the heroes contact the <strong>decoy</strong> or one of the <strong>informants.</strong> He will order his conspirators to go along with whatever plan the heroes propose, within reason, and encourage them to find an excuse to get the heroes outside into the <strong>alleyway</strong> (see this enlarged map, and possibly @JournalEntry[NaCAfYeI8kmmMygm]{6-05 Imperial Pursuit, Part 1}). If a fight breaks out, <strong>Dos</strong> uses his talents to help without drawing attention to himself, if possible. He directly engages the heroes once he is in a position to try to lead them outside. If<strong> Lt. Dos</strong> is discovered at any time, or if he ever hears the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> mentioned, he actively tries to usher the heroes outside, calling for backup along the way. If the heroes observe him directly, allow them to make <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> versus his <strong>Charisma (Deception) check</strong> to attempt to penetrate his disguise.</p>\n<p><strong>Lt. Dos</strong> will not go quietly and tries to avoid capture, even fighting to the death. However, if the characters succeed in capturing him, they may quiz him on the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> He will resist as long as possible and isn’t willing to give up information on the project he works so hard to keep secret. However, if the characters figure out a way to get it out of him, he reveals that his <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.g1khCbcSlJbQ4CLZ]{Code cylinder}</em> allows access to the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> up to<strong> level 189</strong>.

Any fight that breaks out inside the <strong>Outlander</strong> is allowed to continue for <strong>5 rounds</strong> before security demands that they take it outside. However, security will not directly get involved in the fight, not wanting to risk harm to save the hated <strong>ISB agent</strong> and his companions. The crowd will clear the area and become a hazard to the heroes (see <strong>Features of the Area</strong>). If the agents manage to get the heroes outside, (by deception or by baiting the heroes into chasing them out the door), use the alley portions of the map or extend it into @JournalEntry[NaCAfYeI8kmmMygm]{6-05 Imperial Pursuit, Part 1} to continue the encounter. However, the Imperials from that encounter don’t arrive until the heroes have a chance to deal with <strong>Dos</strong> and the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Ad-Hoc EXP Award:</strong> For chasing down <strong>Lt. Dos</strong>, the heroes should receive experience points equal to defeating a <strong>CR 12</strong> encounter. For acquiring his <em>code cylinder</em>, they should receive experience equal to defeating a <strong>CR 12</strong> encounter. Finally, for dealing with the crowd, the heroes should receive experience equal to defeating a <strong>CR 10</strong> encounter (reduce this award if they were not careful with the bystanders). All of these awards are in addition to the standard experience points awarded for this encounter.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/6/6-04_outlander.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"702\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>The club is crowded, and the lower floor is filled with patrons constantly moving about or standing in groups, talking, watching the viewscreens, or drinking.

It is a challenge that can likely be overcome only through battle—an important evolution from the stealth and investigation of the early stages of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign to the beginning of open opposition to the Empire, of course if the players have a sufficiently good plan it should be allowed. It is also where the heroes first <strong>encounter Sartok,</strong> who will guide them in the rest of the adventure.</p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t seem inclined to free <strong>Sartok</strong> from the <strong>detention camp</strong>, you might need to encourage them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If they have befriended any characters in the city, that character can be grabbed and thrown into the <strong>camp.</strong></li>\n<li>If they are focused on finding and stealing information from the Empire, let them overhear that a data slicer working for <strong>Sartok</strong> was thrown in the <strong>camp.</strong> Once the heroes get inside, they find only <strong>Sartok,</strong> who promises to share the slicer’s information if the heroes help with the coming riots.</li>\n<li>If they seem worried about particular Imperial forces (such as the <strong>AT-STs</strong>), let them see those forces head out to patrol several hours away from the city, creating a window of opportunity.</li>\n<li>If they think that the <strong>Nazren</strong> in the <strong>camp</strong> are safe, at least temporarily, have <strong>stormtroopers</strong> start to post execution times for the next <strong>day.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the heroes attack the camp, run “<strong>The Breakout</strong>” encounter below. If they simply refuse to get involved, <strong>Sartok</strong> escapes on his own after a <strong>few days</strong> and seeks the heroes to propose an alliance between them. In that case, skip “<strong>The Breakout</strong>” encounter and proceed with the adventure without this encounter.</p>\n<h2>The Breakout</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[VngPNoBYn7k7Byef]{5-02 The Breakout}</strong></p>\n<h2>Nurturing a Revolt</h2>\n<p>If the heroes allow <strong>Sartok</strong> to lead them to his safe cavern, the resistance leader picks up a few cached belongings and asks his guests to sit comfortably. At this point, <strong>Sartok</strong> is dressed as humbly as any <strong>Nazren,</strong> but he carries a satchel over one shoulder, in which he keeps a hidden <em>blaster.</em> The second and fourth fingers are missing from his left hand, and he has numerous scars, including some across his face. He is darker brown than most <strong>Nazren,</strong> with lighter splotches of skin at his wrinkles and creases. As an older member of his species, he has seen much that he'd rather not have witnessed.</p>\n<p>If the heroes have any pressing needs (such as treating serious injuries), <strong>Sartok</strong> helps see to them before speaking.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Sartok makes a quick sweep of the cavern, checking to ensure that it has not been disturbed. Apparently satisfied, he crouches by the simple fire and motions for you to sit. He takes a few long breaths, then turns and speaks to you.</em></p>\n<p><em>“My world is enslaved, and we have come to realize that no negotiation or appeal to reason can free us. The only way we shall regain control of Nizon is to take it back by force, which requires us to face the weapons and training of the Empire. That battle must begin here—all other settlements look to us for inspiration and leadership. For the sake of our world, we must take up arms against our oppressors.</em></p>\n<p><em>“The cost shall be high for my people, but they are eager to pay it. The cost for remaining slaves would be higher, and it would be paid by our children and our children’s children. If you will help us, we are ready to throw off the yoke of tyranny, even if we lose our lives. Liberty is too precious to sell for the chance of quieter, safer lives under the dark shadow of oppression.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I have allies throughout the city who are ready to raise arms against the Empire at my signal. We are not a warlike people, but the stormtroopers have shown us the basics of violence, and we have learned the lesson well. Against soldiers, I have no doubt that my people would fight bravely with a fair chance at victory. But the Imperial forces have vehicles—large, metal, two-legged machines of war—that we cannot face. My people fear these machines, and though many would still fight bravely, too many would wait to see if we could topple them. Such an attack would be staggered and lose too much of its impact. Only if many of us take up arms at once can we overthrow our oppressors.</em></p>\n<p><em>“But you are outsiders, and to be standing here, you must have opposed the Empire’s machines successfully. Many of my less confident allies believe that with your aid, even the walking war machines could not stop us. This would give them the confidence to bring enough forces to bear at once. If we can take control of the planetary shields and turbolasers that they have nearly finished building on Mount Antas, we can complete those structures ourselves and use them to defend against further Imperial attack. The first step in such an attack is a citywide riot, which I am prepared to trigger.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I know this world is not yours, that our people are not your people. But if you will aid us, you will always have a place of honor among the Nazren.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Obviously, this is a big step, and the heroes probably have numerous questions. Below are answers to some likely questions.</p>\n<p><strong>How did the Empire seize control?</strong> “<em>They came as friends, claiming that we were in danger of being attacked by Separatists who wished to use our world as a secret base. The Empire landed troops and built barracks. Then, after they had more weapons than we did, they took over the city and the mountain and begin shipping our people off like cattle.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>What are you planning to do during the riot?</strong> “<em>I have every intention of fighting by your side. I can guide you around the city and ensure that your help goes where it is needed the most. I would not ask you to take any risk that I am unwilling to take myself.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>How many Nazren will join you?</strong> “<em>Dozens at first, then hundreds, and then, I believe, thousands. Eventually, we might be able to bring the whole world into the fight.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Where does the Empire keep its important records? </strong>“<em>They might be in the control center below Martyr’s Plaza. It houses our most advanced computer system, which tracks major rogue fragments in orbit. The Empire currently controls it and thus flies safely in our skies. Another possible location is the construction site on Mount Antas. It is heavily guarded, but if we take the city, the Empire will be forced to move many soldiers into the streets, leaving the site more vulnerable.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>How will you prevent the Empire from returning and taking over again?</strong> “<em>If we regain control of the tracking station, we can ensure that the Empire’s ships are threatened by space debris and that only our allies can safely fly near our world.</em>”</p>\n<p>If the heroes reject <strong>Sartok’s</strong> request for help, the resistance leader still gives the signal for his people to riot, thus allowing the adventure to continue. However, the <strong>Nazren</strong> are brutally suppressed and treated even more harshly by the Imperials.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Note:</strong> Rescuing Sartok and finishing the discussion with him before the riots happen should be considered a level up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[G5gpl7BmZdUxpmLf]{Sartok}</strong></p>\n<h2>The Riots</h2>\n<p><strong>Sartok</strong> allows the heroes as much time as they need to prepare before sending the word to begin the <strong>uprising.</strong> Once he does, however, things start to move very quickly. The <strong>riots</strong> are a series of several <strong>encounters</strong> that can occur in any order, with one exception. The <strong>“Point Gold” encounter</strong> must be the final encounter of the adventure, as it signals the end of the Imperial dominance of <strong>Nizon.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sartok</strong> can lead the heroes through the city to these <strong>encounters,</strong> or they can find their own way. Regardless, you are free to determine which encounters the heroes must deal with and in what order. Additionally, you can design your own <strong>noncombat encounters,</strong> particularly challenges that require the use of skills. For these challenges, use the following guidelines:<strong> easy task: DC 10</strong>, <strong>moderate task: DC 15</strong>, <strong>hard task: DC 20</strong>, and c<strong>hallenging task: DC 25</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example, during the riots, an injured <strong>Nazren</strong> resistance fighter might become trapped on top of a condemned building, with no way to get down. You might determine that getting to the <strong>Nazren</strong> would be a <strong>hard</strong> task (allowing <strong>Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks</strong> to balance on the crumbling stairs or <strong>Strength (Athletics) checks</strong> to scale the outside of the building) at <strong>DC 20</strong>. Once the heroes reach the roof, they can provide medical assistance or lower the <strong>Nazren</strong> safely to the ground.</p>\n<p>Below are several <strong>skill-based encounters</strong> that you can use between <strong>combat encounters.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Nazren resistance fighter</strong> picks up transmissions on an Imperial channel from a guard post that has received word of the <strong>riots.</strong> The heroes must pose as Imperial officers, making <strong>Charisma (Deception)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong> to convince the <strong>guard post</strong> not to send reinforcements.</li>\n<li>A stash of <strong>weapons</strong> in an Imperial <strong>garrison</strong> could be enough to turn the tide in several sections of the city. The heroes try to use <strong>Charisma (Deception)</strong> to bluff their way into the garrison or <strong>Dexterity (Stealth)</strong> to sneak in, obtaining the weapons and funneling them to the resistance.</li>\n<li>A communications array atop a <strong>Nazren</strong> building needs to be disabled so that the Empire cannot signal the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> for help. The heroes can make <strong>Strength (Athletics) checks</strong> to reach the roof and then plant explosives. Alternatively, they might make <strong>Intelligence (slicer's kit) checks</strong> to seize control of the array and use it to coordinate groups of <strong>resistance fighters</strong> throughout the city.</li>\n<li>A group of captured <strong>resistance fighters</strong> was abandoned in a detention facility when the Imperial guards were called away to reinforce another position. The heroes must make <strong>Intelligence (slicers kit)</strong> or <strong>Strength checks </strong>to open the cell doors, allowing the prisoners to escape and join the resistance.</li>\n<li>For months, <strong>Nazren slaves</strong> have been covertly stowing the parts for an anti-aircraft weapon in secret locations, and now the <strong>resistance</strong> needs to build the weapon to protect against attacks by <strong>V-wing</strong> fighters stationed on <strong>Nizon.</strong> The heroes must help carry the heavy equipment up to the roof of a building, where the weapon must be assembled quickly with<strong> Intelligence checks</strong>.</li>\n<li>The chaos of the <strong>riots</strong> has left many resistance groups scattered and uncoordinated. One group in particular has obtained access codes to the Imperial <strong>garrison,</strong> but the group cannot be found. The heroes must make <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> to locate the missing <strong>Nazren</strong> or find alternative ways to contact them.</li>\n<li>Once the riots are well underway, <strong>Sartok</strong> needs the heroes’ assistance in coordinating the rest of the attacks. They can make <strong>Intelligence checks </strong>to plan the next attack or make <strong>Intelligence checks</strong> to notice flaws in <strong>Sartok’s</strong> plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Checkpoint Gamma</h2>\n<p>One of the ways that the Empire has kept the local population under control is with heavily armed checkpoints throughout the city. Movement is limited to those with the proper Imperial forms, making it difficult for the <strong>Nazren</strong> to gather and plan. Now, reports come to the heroes that a central checkpoint, <strong>Gamma,</strong> is being held by <strong>AT-RT</strong> walkers equipped with heavy weapons. Unless it can be opened up, the small units of <strong>Nazren</strong> trying to start an uprising won’t be able to get together to form more effective squads of rioters.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[mNg9gSULmWMwyB9a]{5-03 Checkpoint Gamma}</strong></p>\n<h2>Collateral Damage</h2>\n<p>As the Imperial forces begin to react to the rioting, a set of cannons on <strong>Mount Antas</strong> starts to bombard residential areas. As the heroes run by a building, it takes a hit and begins to collapse. Fire breaks out in the lower floors, and numerous young Nazren are trapped within the structure.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[FMVzhDhXQeozFXOZ]{5-04 Collateral Damage}</strong></p>\n<h2>Rest Stop</h2>\n<p>As the heroes make their way through the city, they find themselves cornered by advancing Imperial <strong>artillery.</strong> Fortunately, the heroes have earned a reputation in the city by now, and a <strong>Nazren</strong> woman comes to their aid, leading them to a safehouse to rest. This should give the heroes a chance to recover and heal, though their respite doesn’t last long. <strong>Crab droids</strong> sent by <strong>Vril Vrakth</strong> find the safehouse and burrow inside.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[92r75hcciHc77yF6]{5-05 Rest Stop}</strong></p>\n<h2>The Black Ship</h2>\n<p>During the <strong>rioting,</strong> the heroes see a <strong>black cargo vessel</strong> fly overhead, trailing smoke from badly tuned engines. The <strong>ship</strong> has the same markings as the <strong>slave transport</strong> they saw in <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, as well as the <strong>ship</strong> that was being escorted off <strong>Nizon</strong> by the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong>. The <strong>black ship</strong> shrugs off light weapons fire from the surface and lands a short distance away. If <strong>Sartok</strong> is still with the heroes, he informs them that the vessel has landed near the <strong>slave pens,</strong> where there is still one shipload of <strong>Nazren</strong> scheduled to be flown offworld and sold into slavery.</p>\n<p>The <strong>black ship</strong> is the same type as the one encountered in <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>—a <strong>Gallofree Yards Medium Transport.</strong> It is staffed by <strong>18 Trandoshan slavers</strong>, though only <strong>nine</strong> of them are free to fight at any given moment. The rest remain inside the <strong>ship,</strong> struggling to repair the damaged systems so that it can take off again as soon as the latest crop of <strong>slaves</strong> is aboard.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[XJ1kU4P63JNOesou]{5-06 The Black Ship}</strong></p>\n<h2>Martyr's Plaza</h2>\n<p>As the <strong>riots</strong> spread through the city, more and more Imperial forces leave their posts to reinforce troops in trouble elsewhere. Eventually, up to half the forces in each security zone have moved off, leaving those locations as vulnerable as they’ll ever be. In particular, the forces in <strong>Martyr’s Plaza</strong> have sent away one of their two <strong>AT-STs</strong> and several dozen <strong>troopers,</strong> leaving it less well guarded than at any time during the Imperial occupation. At the center of the plaza is the access to the underground control center, which directs all communications on <strong>Nizon</strong> and monitors the asteroid fragments that endanger nearby starships. As long as Imperial forces hold the control center, their vessels can fly freely through space around <strong>Nizon</strong> and land troops wherever they wish.</p>\n<p>When word comes of the reduced security at the entrance to the control center, <strong>Sartok</strong> tells the heroes (either face to face or via commlink) to move to <strong>Martyr’s Plaza</strong> and secure the entrance. If the heroes do so, they will allow the <strong>Nazren</strong> to take control of the center, which will enable them to keep the Empire off their world indefinitely.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[hooa0Z0uGbbvQcGK]{5-07 Battle for Martyr's Plaza}</strong></p>\n<h2>Point Gold</h2>\n<p>Capturing the control center is the endgame of <strong>Sartok’s</strong> plans to take back the planet, and once that has been accomplished, the <strong>Nazren</strong> believe that victory and freedom are inevitable. The Empire, however, has no faith in something as simple as asteroid fragments or a tracking station to secure a whole world. They have begun construction of a planetary <strong>turbolaser battery</strong> on <strong>Mount Antas</strong> outside the city, along with a shield generator large enough to cover the <strong>turbolasers</strong> and the city itself. While only one <strong>battery</strong> is currently operational, it has the firepower to challenge even a Star Destroyer and could be used to clear a section of space of rogue asteroid fragments, allowing troop ships to land. As long as the <strong>mountain base</strong> is in Imperial hands, more forces could return to retake the planet.</p>\n<p>This base, <strong>Point Gold,</strong> is currently manned mostly by neutral technicians and minor Imperial officers. While Imperial doctrine calls for it to have an <strong>AT-AT</strong> and a division of troops, they have not arrived yet. All ground forces from the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> were deployed throughout the city, and if the heroes have taken out the <strong>AT-ST</strong> already, they’ve dealt with the largest part of the ground forces.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>Vril Vrakth</strong> has been using <strong>Point Gold</strong> as a base of operations for his attempts to target <strong>Sartok</strong> and the heroes. His ship is docked on a small landing bay at the edge of a construction platform, guarded by however many <strong>crab droids</strong> remain. With the whole planet in open revolt, <strong>Vrakth</strong> has been waiting for an opportunity to capture the heroes, assuming that they are behind the riots. The Zabrak bounty hunter has pulled the datachip for the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> since he knows that the Imperials want it destroyed, and placed it in the center of the <strong>160-foot-square</strong> construction platform, which is<strong> 200 feet</strong> up in the partially finished shield generator. He wants to be high up so that he can see the heroes coming. <strong>Vrakth</strong> believes that he can defeat them, turn the tide on the revolt, and collect a huge bounty from the Empire.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[TTYvb1ih0td36D7e]{5-08 Point Gold}</strong></p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>Though <strong>Vrakth</strong> did not destroy the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> datachip, he still damaged it. It takes time and a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to get anything out of the cracked, burned chip. If the heroes can’t manage that task, they have allies who can. Eventually, they discover that the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> is a massive construction effort taking place in the <strong>Deep Core,</strong> with costs so high that the Empire decided to complete it with <strong>slave labor.</strong> The information on the datachip does not specify any details about what, exactly, is being built. But all contacts and notes are tied directly to <strong>Coruscant,</strong> which seems to be the place to go for more information on the project.</p>\n<p>The heroes are now honored allies of <strong>Nizon,</strong> treated with respect by any <strong>Nazren</strong> they encounter. <strong>Sartok</strong> begins to work toward a planetary council, though he confesses to the heroes that he hopes he isn’t on it— he’d prefer to leave his leadership role behind. He does, however, ask the heroes to take a message of friendship to <strong>Senator Organa</strong>, along with an offer that the <strong>Nazren</strong> will help him against the Empire in the future. This victory is minor in the grand scheme of things, but it’s an important beginning, proving that the Empire can be defeated, at least on small planets outside the <strong>Core Worlds.</strong></p>\n<p>If any heroes were killed during the adventure, the grateful <strong>Nazren</strong> erect a statue in their honor in <strong>Martyr’s Plaza.</strong></p>\n<p>For the Empire’s part, losing the <strong>Nazren</strong> as a source of slave labor is irritating, but thanks to the tracking station, they have little choice but to stay clear of the planet—at least temporarily. The Empire is too new to spend many resources dealing with the <strong>Nazren,</strong> and work on the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> can continue with Wookiee and Mon Calamari slaves. Believing that all information on the project has been destroyed, the Imperials abandon the world for the time being.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> finishing the adventure</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"rBRBpAag1mn1GfSw","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

They have no interest in the trapped children and don’t target them, but the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> shoot at any hero or armed <strong>Nazren.</strong> The <strong>stormtroopers</strong> try to hold their defensible position on the warehouse roof, but they move if forced to (such as if someone throws a gas grenade onto the roof).

The old Clone Wars-era <strong>artillery</strong> has suffered a malfunction and won’t be able to fire for another <strong>15 minutes</strong> or so. The <em>commlink</em> is attached to a <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.ocgGeQbanfF5wXh5]{Datapad}</em> that shows the artillery’s concealed location.

Moving through the building is hard because it’s badly damaged, and the whole building counts as <strong>difficult terrain.</strong></p>\n<p>The bottom floor is on fire. Each <strong>round</strong> that the heroes are in it, they must make a <strong>DC 12 Dexterity saving throw</strong>, taking <strong>[[/r 2d10[fire] # Fire damage]] damage</strong> on a failed <strong>save</strong> and catch fire. With a success, they only take half <strong>damage</strong> and do not catch fire. Taking reasonable precautions (such as getting wet or covering up with a thick blanket) grants <strong>advantage</strong> to the <strong>saving throw.</strong> A character who is on fire can put themselves out as an <strong>action </strong>and takes the same <strong>damage</strong> on subsequent rounds if not.</p>\n<p>The entire burning building is also a <strong>smoke hazard.</strong> Each <strong>round</strong> that a character is exposed to a <strong>smoke hazard,</strong> every creature inside needs to hold its breath or begin to <a href=\"https://sw5e.com/rules/phb/adventuring#suffocating\"><strong>suffocate</strong></a> from the smoke inhalation. The <strong>smoke hazard</strong> is also considered to be <strong>heavily obscured</strong>.</p>\n<p>Though the stairs in the burning building still work, they are in the far corner, reachable only by moving through a lot of smoke and fire. The turbolift shaft, which is closer, no longer has a working turbolift, but it can be climbed with a <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. A character can also climb up the outside of the building with a <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check</strong>. Climbing up the outside of the building protects a hero from smoke damage but not from the fire. Climbing while carrying another creature imposes <strong>disadvantage.</strong></p>\n<p>The roof of the burning building is currently free of <strong>fire</strong> and <strong>smoke hazards,</strong> but that won’t last long. Every <strong>5 rounds</strong>, one randomly selected square of the roof catches fire, and all surrounding squares become <strong>smoke hazards.</strong> Once there is no longer enough room on the roof for all refugees, they begin to jump. A falling creature must make a <strong>DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</strong>. On a failed <strong>save,</strong> the character takes <strong>14 ([[/r 4d6[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]) damage</strong> taking <strong>half damage </strong>if they pass. (The adult Nazren in the area gather around the building, ignoring <strong>stormtrooper</strong> fire to catch any <strong>children</strong> who jump so that the kids don’t take <strong>falling damage</strong>.)</p>\n<p>The <strong>warehouse</strong> is in much better shape. A lip runs around the outer edge, allowing any <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.r2bQT0RrvwFIWKGh]{Prone}</strong> character to gain <strong>full cover</strong> against <strong>attacks</strong> made from the ground or the burning building.

At the end of the<strong> first day </strong>in the <strong>palace</strong>, the Hutt gives each hero his or her own room in the guest quarters, which were actually the servants’ quarters when the building was owned by Neimoidian nobles. The rooms are surprisingly clean, though sparsely appointed, and Gamorrean guards casually patrol the halls during the evenings. The heroes have a few amenities at their disposal—servants bring food or drink to their quarters—and if they have done something to impress the Hutt during the day, he might send them evening gifts, such as fine foods, spice, or even entertainment (in various forms).</p>\n<p>Below are several encounters that can take place in any order during the time between events in <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>throne room.</strong></p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":-200000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

A third control panel exists on the torture platform at the foot of the examination table. No skill <strong>check</strong> is needed to activate a control panel unless someone at another panel is trying to send a counter-command.

After a brush with some agents of <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Bail Organa}</strong>, the heroes find themselves drawn into a conflict with the Empire. Delivering vital information to the Senator on <strong>Alderaan </strong>earns the heroes his trust, and soon<strong> </strong><strong>Bail Organa</strong> sends them on a mission of his own. It seems that a former Imperial Admiral by the name of <strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Gilder Varth}</strong> has been funneling information about the Empire to the Senator for some months now, though he has gone silent since being arrested and imprisoned on the planet <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes travel to <strong>Felucia</strong>, encounter some of the natives, and locate the Imperial prison facility where the Admiral is being held. After making their way through the facility, they rescue <strong>Admiral </strong><strong>Gilder Varth</strong> and take him to a safe location. The rescue not only cements the heroes as trustworthy agents (earning them more aid and work from <strong>Bail Organa</strong>) but also marks the first step in building a resistance against the Empire.</p>\n<h2>A Wretched Hive</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p>Freed by the heroes from the Imperial prison facility, <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> once again begins revealing valuable information on clandestine activities of the Empire. In particular, he mentions that he was responsible for funneling money and resources to something called the “<strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>.” Among those he sent funds to was a Hutt crime lord named <strong>Darga</strong>, who operates out of a ruined city on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Traveling to the <strong>Neimoidian</strong> colony world, the heroes manage to infiltrate <strong>Darga’s</strong> palace and step into a den of vile debauchery. While in the palace, the heroes attempt to obtain more information on the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> while avoiding the wrath of the Hutt gangster.</p>\n<p>The heroes’ searches lead them to a startling discovery: <strong>Darga </strong>has been keeping a Jedi Master and veteran of the Clone Wars in a coma in the dungeons of his palace. After the heroes free <strong>Master Denia</strong>, she helps them deal with the Hutt’s majordomo, a Force-sensitive criminal who has been using the Force to rise in power within <strong>Darga’s </strong>organization. The heroes overhear a conversation between the majordomo and Imperial Inquisitor <strong>Draco</strong>, which introduces them to one of the main villains of the campaign. By the time they handle the majordomo, the Hutt has fled (not wanting to engage in direct conflict with a Jedi Master), and the heroes leave <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The Queen of Air and Darkness</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p>After dropping <strong>Master Denia</strong> off with their Alderaanian<strong> </strong>allies, the heroes learn that <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> has fled to the famous world of <strong>Bespin</strong>—more specifically, to <strong>Cloud City</strong>. Still needing the information the Hutt possesses, the heroes travel to <strong>Cloud City</strong> only to discover that their quarry has vanished. However, in their search for the crime lord, they discover that another Imperial officer who dealt with the Hutt will be visiting <strong>Cloud City</strong> to take part in its annual <strong>sabacc</strong> tournament.</p>\n<p>The majority of the adventure centers around the tournament. The heroes can choose to enter the tournament, work for the tournament’s administrator as hired help, or simply observe the tournament in order to get close to the dirty officer.</p>\n<p>After a series of event-based encounters, the tournament ends and the heroes convince the Imperial officer to reveal the Hutt’s location. When they go to confront the crime lord, they discover that he’s attempting to make his getaway. The heroes face <strong>Darga </strong>in the hangar bay of his personal luxury yacht and learn the awful truth—the Hutt was using his contacts in the <strong>Tibanna </strong>gas industry to funnel large amounts of the gas to the Empire in exchange for <strong>slaves</strong>.</p>\n<p>In fact, one such transaction was supposed to take place under the cover of the tournament, but the heroes’ involvement spoiled those plans. Now, the Empire is determined to erase any trace of the transaction by crashing a <strong>slave ship</strong> into the <strong>Tibanna </strong>gas hauler in orbit, destroying them both. The heroes, commandeering<strong> Z-95 headhunters</strong>, race against time under fire from Imperial starfighters to stop the crash and save the <strong>slaves</strong>’ lives.</p>\n<h2>Echoes of the Jedi</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Abel G. Peña</strong></em></p>\n<p>After a bout of downtime (during which Gamemasters can insert their own adventures, should they so choose), the heroes are gathered by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. Their encounter with the slave ship over <strong>Bespin </strong>indicates that the Empire is trafficking in slaves, but the slaves were members of a species that <strong>Denia </strong>had never encountered. To discover more about these mysterious slaves (and perhaps unravel the mystery of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>), She sends the heroes to the planet <strong>Almas </strong>in the <strong>Cularin System</strong>, once home to a Jedi academy. There, the heroes must retrieve a lost Jedi <strong>holocron</strong> that can teach <strong>Denia </strong>special <strong>farseeing techniques</strong>, which she hopes will lead her to the mysterious aliens.</p>\n<p>The heroes arrive at <strong>Almas </strong>to find the academy in shambles, having been destroyed from orbit when the Empire rose. The heroes dig their way down through the ruins to reach the academy’s archives. Along the way, they discover that the <strong>dark side</strong> has grown strong in the ruins of the academy, and it has become a domain of evil—much like the cave on <strong>Dagobah </strong>where <strong>Luke </strong>fought the false <strong>Darth Vader</strong>. The heroes face dark side spirits and their own fears as they press onward into the wrecked temple.</p>\n<p>As they approach the archives, they discover that they are not the first to explore the ruins. A small contingent of <strong>Imperial troops</strong> has arrived ahead of them and defends the archives with lethal force. Eventually, the heroes confront the leader of the Imperial contingent, Inquisitor <strong>Draco</strong>. They defeat him and retrieve the <strong>holocron</strong>, which they take back to <strong>Denia</strong>.</p>\n<h2>The First to Strike</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Owen K.C. Stephens</strong></em></p>\n<p>The <strong>holocron </strong>taken from the ruins of the <strong>Almas </strong>academy proves helpful, and <strong>Master Denia</strong> is able to use the Force to locate the mysterious alien slaves. They were members of the <strong>Nazren </strong>species from the planet <strong>Nizon </strong>in the <strong>Maldrood Sector</strong>. The heroes travel to that world to see if they can discover more about the <strong>Nazren</strong>, but they find the planet under Imperial occupation. Even more troubling, the Empire has allowed <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> to harvest slaves from the planet at will, provided that they also transport some of the slaves to Imperial projects. A core resistance group of <strong>Nazren</strong> has formed, but they seem to be waiting for some kind of catalyst to begin their open opposition. The heroes are just the catalyst they need.</p>\n<p>Working with a charismatic <strong>Nazren </strong>resistance leader in the capital city, the heroes incite a riot against the Imperial oppressors. The city erupts into violence, and the heroes assist the <strong>Nazren </strong>in overthrowing the Imperial invaders, rescuing <strong>Nazren </strong>slaves from <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong>, preventing the riots from claiming innocent lives, and seizing Imperial facilities to help defend the planet. The heroes help the <strong>Nazren </strong>reclaim their world for their own.</p>\n<h2>The Core of Corruption</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Sterling Hershey</strong></em></p>\n<p>While on <strong>Nizon</strong>, the heroes discover Imperial transmissions regarding the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. The messages indicate that the engineers of the project are in an Imperial facility on <strong>Coruscant</strong>—and that is where the heroes must go. Traveling to Imperial Center, the heroes sneak past the world’s defenses and take their first steps on the capital planet of the <strong>Galactic Empire</strong>. Under the watchful eye of the Empire, the heroes pinpoint the location of the <strong>project’s architects</strong> and travel to a massive skyscraper still under construction.</p>\n<p>Moving up through the skyscraper, the heroes soon come face to face with the <strong>engineers </strong>of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. Unfortunately, they are all being watched by several members of the <strong>Inquisitorius</strong>, who fight the heroes to the death. When their defeat seems imminent, the <strong>Inquisitors </strong>detonate explosives at the base of the skyscraper, which begins to collapse. The heroes must fight their way back out of the collapsing building and make their way to safety.</p>\n<p>However, the heroes finally learn the details of the<strong> Sarlacc Project</strong>. The Empire is constructing a massive new starship <strong>12 kilometers long</strong>— many times larger than a <strong>Star Destroyer</strong>, and an early prototype (though not the final version) of the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. The new vessel will serve as the flagship of the Imperial fleet, and the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> nears completion.</p>\n<h2>A Reckoning of Wraiths</h2>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">By Rodney Thompson</span></strong></em></p>\n<p>After transmitting their knowledge of the project to <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> agents, the heroes are instructed to make contact with a group of loyalists in <strong>Coruscant’s</strong> seedy underbelly. When they arrive at the meeting location, however, they discover that the loyalists are all dead. The heroes return to their safe house—only to fall into a trap set by the Empire! Fighting their way back to their ship, the heroes find the hangar being defended by a massive <strong>AT-AT</strong>. They must bring the <strong>AT-AT</strong> down (using whatever means necessary) before they can board their ship.</p>\n<p>Blasting their way out of <strong>Coruscant</strong>, the heroes arrive at a rendezvous point where a <strong>Nebulon-B frigate </strong>(the <strong><em>Resurgence</em></strong>) waits for them. Unfortunately, when they arrive, they learn that the trap was sprung not only on them but also on their allies. As an <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer </strong>pounds on the <em>Resurgence’s </em>shields, the heroes board the <strong>Nebulon-B </strong>and try to rescue survivors. Battling an <strong>Imperial boarding party</strong> on the ship, they fight their way to the main launch bay just in time to see <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong>—apparently still alive after the confrontation on Almas, and now cybernetically enhanced—dragging <strong>Master Denia</strong> into his shuttle.</p>\n<p>As <strong>Draco </strong>blasts off, the heroes must flee the crumbling ship and make their way into hyperspace. Worse, as they blast their way free of the exploding <strong><em>Resurgence</em></strong>, they discover the architect of their betrayal: <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>. They receive a transmission from the Admiral aboard the <strong>Imperial Star Destroyer</strong>, who reveals that he has merely been trying to uncover <strong>Organa’s </strong>treachery all along. The heroes manage to escape the Empire, but only after suffering grievous losses.</p>\n<h2>The Gem of Alderaan</h2>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">By Gary M.

Eventually, word reaches the heroes that they have been summoned back to <strong>Alderaan </strong>by <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. <strong>Senator Organa</strong> has learned that<strong> Master Denia</strong> was taken to the planet <strong>Prakith</strong>, in the <strong>Deep Core</strong>, and that reaching her will be nearly impossible thanks to Imperial security along those <strong>hyperlanes</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">However, the heroes learn that <strong>Lady Alya Aldrete</strong>, an <strong>Alderaanian noble</strong>, might have the means of getting them to the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. Apparently,<strong> Lady Alya</strong> employs smugglers, and she has managed to obtain passage for them through the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. She is the guest of honor on the first run of a new high-speed repulsortrain leaving the city of <strong>Aldera </strong>for a six-hour trip. The heroes board the repulsortrain and try to get an audience with <strong>Lady Alya</strong>, with little success.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Things turn sour quickly when a group of mercenaries attacks the repulsortrain. The heroes must deal with the mercenaries and protect the noblewoman to get the help they need. After the attackers are defeated, <strong>Lady Alya</strong> reveals that her connections in the<strong> Deep Core </strong>go quite deep, and she has been marshaling an entire fleet of smugglers and pirates right under the Empire’s nose. She agrees to give the heroes the documentation they need to reach <strong>Prakith </strong>safely, and the heroes earn a new ally.</span></p>\n<h2>Sword of the Empire</h2>\n<p><em><strong>By Rodney Thompson</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Traveling through the</span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> Deep Core </strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">to the</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Imperial Fortress World of Prakith</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, the heroes discover that</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Master Denia</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">is being held in none other than the</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Citadel Inquisitorius</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, the newly built headquarters of the</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Emperor’s Jedi hunters</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">.

{"_id":"IDDwZ2jzjwSKInrT","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>The First to Strike</strong></em> is the fourth adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e </strong></em>experience. This adventure is the midpoint of the overall campaign and represents a shift from investigating to actually taking on Imperial forces—and winning. Though a serious of rough and action-filled encounters, the heroes should advance to <strong>11th level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will free a planet from Imperial tyranny, become allies with some of that planet’s leaders, and discover that the trail to the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> leads right into the heart of the Empire—to <strong>Coruscant</strong> itself.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Summary</h2>\n<p>After weeks of meditation and study, <strong>Master Denia</strong> once more calls the heroes together with news. The meditation techniques she learned from the <strong>holocron</strong> have proven to be helpful, and she believes that she has located the home planet of the <strong>slaves</strong> the heroes rescued in <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>. After consulting the <strong>Force,</strong> she believes that the alien <strong>slaves</strong> were in fact Nazren, a species from <strong>Nizon,</strong> an obscure planet in the <strong>Maldrood Sector</strong>.</p>\n<p>A special request by <strong>Senator Organa</strong> to the <strong>University of Aldera</strong> revealed only that the planet <strong>Nizon</strong> is a barren world in the <strong>Centares System</strong>. It lies near <strong>Centares,</strong> an industrial world occupied by the Empire from which Imperial forces have been withdrawing for some months now. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> has managed to locate <strong>Nizon</strong> in his navcomputer and is willing to share the coordinates with the heroes if they agree to investigate the world.</p>\n<h3>Arrival</h3>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in the <strong>Centares System</strong>, they discover an Imperial presence not so lessened as they would like to believe. A Victory II-class Star Destroyer floats in orbit, and a number of smaller capital ships and corvettes dot the space above <strong>Nizon.</strong> As the heroes arrive, they witness a transport ship (similar to the slave ship from <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>) leave <strong>Nizon’s</strong> orbit and jump to hyperspace for parts unknown. Slipping past the Imperial Navy will not be easy; the heroes are fired upon for violating Imperial space. To make matters worse, the space around <strong>Nizon</strong> is filled with fragmentary asteroids, known as rogue fragments, that pose a constant danger to anyone without access to the tracking information being broadcast from the planet’s surface.</p>\n<p>After the heroes land (or crash) on <strong>Nizon,</strong> it soon becomes clear that their help is sorely needed. <strong>Nizon</strong> is a barren world covered in dirty red clay with powerful gusts of wind. The gales kick up dust storms that make the planet barely habitable, and the heroes are required to wear breath masks to filter out the dust. The <strong>Nazren’s</strong> only major city lies not far from the heroes’ vessel and should be a natural place for them to begin their search for information.</p>\n<h3>The Lay of the Land</h3>\n<p>Inside the city, the heroes discover that Imperial oppression is alive and well on <strong>Nizon; stormtroopers</strong> march down the streets, an <strong>AT-ST</strong> walks around the wider avenues, and <strong>V-wing starfighters</strong> scream overhead every now and again. The <strong>Nazren</strong> themselves, hulking beings comparable in size to Wookiees, lumber through the streets with their shoulders hunched and their eyes downcast, but a smoldering look of hatred boils just below their stoic surfaces. In addition to the <strong>Nazren</strong> and the Imperials, <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> prod groups of <strong>Nazren</strong> along or gather at the entrances to buildings, eyeing the <strong>Nazren</strong> like farmers eyeing cattle. Other species are present in the city, too, allowing the heroes to move through the streets without being accosted at every turn.</p>\n<p>The heroes eventually make contact with <strong>Sartok,</strong> the leader of an underground resistance movement. The <strong>Nazren</strong> have been planning to overthrow their Imperial masters for a while, but thus far, <strong>Sartok</strong> has been unable to convince enough of his people that it is possible to defeat the Empire and reclaim their world. After learning of the heroes’ previous successes against the Empire, <strong>Sartok</strong> pleads with them to help him reclaim the <strong>capital city</strong>, which should inspire his people to continue their <strong>rebellion.</strong> If the heroes agree, he fills them in on his plans.</p>\n<h3>Resistance</h3>\n<p>When <strong>Sartok</strong> gives the word, his allies throughout the city begin to riot. The heroes tackle a number of encounters during the riots that aid the <strong>Nazren</strong> in their struggles to reclaim their <strong>capital.</strong> They must help capture an Imperial checkpoint, rescue <strong>Nazren</strong> children trapped in a collapsing building, stop <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> from herding frightened <strong>Nazren</strong> onto their space ship, and so on. The critical battle of the revolt takes place in <strong>Martyr’s Plaza</strong>, which contains the entrance to the planetary control center, which runs all global communications as well as the rogue fragment tracking station.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the heroes face one other unforeseen challenge: a <strong>bounty hunter</strong>. <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong> posted a <strong>bounty</strong> on the heroes after their last encounter, and a <strong>Zabrak</strong> named <strong>Vril Vrakth</strong> has been on their trail for a few weeks. Having learned about <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> request to the <strong>University of Aldera</strong>, <strong>Vrakth</strong> has set himself up on <strong>Nizon</strong> as a scout for the Imperials and the <strong>slavers,</strong> but the heroes are his true prey. The bounty hunter plans to capture the heroes and kill <strong>Sartok,</strong> who also has a <strong>bounty</strong> on his head (though his is “<strong>dead or alive</strong>”). <strong>Vrakth</strong> has <strong>crab droids</strong> from the Clone Wars crawling through the city, reporting anything they find and attacking his prey when possible. If the heroes don’t deal with him prior to their capture of the <strong>control center</strong>, they must face <strong>Vrakth</strong> outside the city, at a <strong>planetary defense battery</strong> being installed by the Empire.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>With the <strong>capital city</strong> securely in the hands of the <strong>Nazren</strong> rebels, word begins to come in that <strong>Nazren</strong> in other settlements have begun their own uprising. Meanwhile, the heroes gain access to an Imperial intelligence <strong>datachip</strong> that was entrusted to <strong>Vril Vrakth.</strong> From this datachip, they learn that the <strong>Nazren slaves</strong> were used as a part of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>, and that every so often, the <strong>slaves</strong> were executed to keep them from spreading word of the project. Additionally, the <strong>datachip</strong> indicates that the orders regarding the<strong> Sarlacc Project</strong> originate from <strong>Coruscant,</strong> which is also referred to as the home of the project’s designers and architects. Thus, the best source of information on the <strong>Sarlacc Project </strong>seems to be one of the most heavily guarded planets in the galaxy. With this knowledge in hand, the heroes return to the <strong><em>Resurgence.</em></strong></p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[XZjvzAAmh866Dgok]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"rBRBpAag1mn1GfSw","sort":-100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Or if the party is <strong>gathering information</strong> on the <strong>upper levels</strong> and has a <strong>Force user</strong> in their midst, it might be good to have a quick reference to what a <strong>Force user</strong> can sense.</p>\n<p>After learning each initial lead, see that lead's entry in <strong>@JournalEntry[s8n15L6XKq1X7hLG]{Part 2}</strong> for details on tracking down their entire clue chain.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Fiat</h2>\n<p>After <strong>24 hours</strong> of investigation, an unspecified underworld contact will contact the party and send them to <strong>Eetoa Roa.</strong></p>\n<h4>Resh</h4>\n<p><strong>Eetoa Ro</strong> will send the heroes after <strong>Resh,</strong> <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">provided they have the money to buy the lead.

He uses his prestigious ISB position to intimidate his targets. He is best known for <strong>“exposing”</strong> so-called alien plots to influence the <strong>Imperial Senate.</strong> It is widely believed by anti-Imperial activists that his investigations are at best massive distortions of the truth and at worst outright fabrications, but they are very effective in eliminating or arresting political dissenters. <strong>Tero</strong> knows this information because <strong>Dos's</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> exploits show up on the local newsnets from time to time.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Imeici Spire</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong>Tero</strong> knows its location but believes it to be nothing more than a cog in the Imperial machine.</span></p>\n<h2>The Force</h2>\n<p>If the heroes try to use the <strong>Force</strong> to investigate:</p>\n<h4>Resh</h4>\n<p>Reaching out through the <strong>Force</strong> through using a <strong>Force power</strong> or class feature can't locate <strong>Resh</strong> directly. However, if the attempt is focused on <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, the heroes see a scene from the past: The <strong>Hutt </strong>is speaking with <strong>Resh</strong> in person and directing him to establish a safehouse in <strong>Commerce Guild Warehouse NW-99c,</strong> a long-abandoned warehouse in the <strong>Works</strong> district. If the attempt is focused on one of <strong>Resh’s</strong> information merchants, it reveals the merchant receiving <strong>Resh’s</strong> direct <strong>commlink code</strong> from the Sullustan personally, along with instructions to find someone who can smuggle <strong>Resh</strong> off the planet. Once the heroes have met <strong>Resh,</strong> any attempts through class feature or <strong>Force power</strong> will reveal the <strong>basics</strong> or <strong>secrets</strong> described in his entry.</p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The Imeici Spire</span></h4>\n<p><strong>Force</strong> sensitive characters automatically sense a disturbance in the <strong>Force</strong> when within <strong>half a mile</strong> of the building. The <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> activities have tainted the tower, adding to the sense of unease felt by many who work on or near the building. Using the <strong>Force</strong> in this area is very dangerous. The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are on constant watch for any remaining <strong>Jedi</strong> or other <strong>Force</strong> users and they regularly try to sense <strong>Force</strong> users in the area. When this occurs (no more than <strong>twice a day</strong>), <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> characters in the area must make a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Deception) or Charisma (Deception) check</strong>. If they fail, the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> become aware of the presence of <strong>Force</strong> sensitives and are prepared for them when they are encountered later in the adventure.</p>\n<h2>Gather Information</h2>\n<p>Investigation can glean the following:</p>\n<h4>ISB Agent Lesan Dos</h4>\n<p>A<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> using generally available sources reveals the same information <strong>Tero</strong> knows about <strong>Dos</strong> (described above) and takes <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Protocol Droid CZ-3T6</h4>\n<p>If the characters had a reason to search for such information, <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">A</span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> taking</span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> [[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> reveals that Republic governmental departments frequently used CZ units, but many were reassigned when newer units were phased in shortly after the Empire’s establishment.</span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Resh</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">If the heroes have some reason to search for <strong>Resh</strong> or someone like him, </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">a</span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> reveals all attempts regarding finding</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Resh</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">must be made on the</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">lower levels</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">of the</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Works</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">district.

Unremarkable during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> thus far, <strong>TC-663</strong> is occasionally seen wandering the halls of the <strong>palace </strong>on one errand or another. At some point when the heroes are all together away from the Hutt’s court, the shiny silver droid approaches them and asks to speak with them in private.</p>\n<p>When he is certain they are alone,<strong> TC-663</strong> (who insists that the heroes call him <strong>Six-Six</strong>) explains that in addition to serving as the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> translator, he also serves another master—a droid crime lord named <strong>Switch,</strong> who lives on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> above the world of <strong>Brentaal.</strong> If the heroes played through <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they have probably already encountered <strong>Switch</strong> and perhaps even offered to act as his agents in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six</strong> reveals that he has come to convey a small piece of information on <strong>Switch’s</strong> behalf. The droid tells the heroes that he has been monitoring communications leaving <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, and it seems that someone has been transmitting information to the Empire while the <strong>Hutt</strong> sleeps, receiving instructions in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six </strong>has been sending these messages on to <strong>Switch,</strong> but the droid crime lord has been unable to break their encryption. <strong>Switch</strong> has ordered<strong> Six-Six</strong> to turn the encrypted transmissions file over to the heroes and see what they can make of it. If the heroes are willing to share their findings with <strong>Six-Six</strong> (who will share them with <strong>Switch),</strong> they can have the file at no charge.</p>\n<p>Any hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> decrypts the file and retrieves the contents of the message. It reveals that late at night, the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> majordomo, <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, has been contacting an Imperial communications relay somewhere in the sector. The heroes cannot be certain who he is communicating with, but they know that <strong>Demos</strong> has been transmitting information about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings—particularly his slave trading—on a regular basis. The most recent communication specifically mentions that the slavers that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with are unhappy with their merchandise. Additionally, several messages mention “<strong>the prisoner</strong>” but provide no further details.</p>\n<p>If confronted about his communications with the Empire, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> staunchly denies it. Presenting the decrypted file does not help because <strong>Demos </strong>claims that it must be a forgery, and <strong>Darga </strong>is inclined to agree with his trusted advisor. If the heroes remain adamant that the majordomo is doing something untoward even after <strong>Darga </strong>dismissed this claim, the <strong>Hutt</strong> might become upset. To represent his shifting attitudes, you might wish to treat a previous incident in which the heroes successfully curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor as a failure instead.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/sixsix/sixsix_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"573\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YcEBkSk41K8jcfDK]{07 - Handout 7 - Six-Six}</p>","folder":"SPlJvAGoq1E0hud7","sort":-12500,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Manufactured by <strong>Bengel Shipbuilders</strong> some years before the beginning of the adventure, <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> has not flourished since the rise of the Empire. Though it still sees a great deal of traffic from <strong>Brentaal </strong>and from travelers, the Empire has allowed large sections of the station to languish and fall apart. Thanks to the rise of anti-alien sentiment, especially on the <strong>Core Worlds</strong>, the more run-down sections of <strong>Sel Zonn Station </strong>are now inhabited by aliens. As such, a rift divides the station—wealthy, privileged Human Imperial loyalists occupy the nicer sections of the station, while all others are relegated to worn and sometimes dangerous secondary sections.</p>\n<p>If the heroes arrive at <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> together aboard the same ship, read the following boxed text aloud.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>Seemingly motionless among a sea of starships and satellites above the twinkling world of Brentaal, Sel Zonn Station grows larger in your view every second. A central pylon forms the bulk of the station’s mass, and three landing platforms leading to docking bays extend from the central section, equidistant from one another and jutting out into space. The dorsal side of the station features a discshaped secondary structure, on top of which blinking lights indicate the presence of a landing platform reserved for wealthy patrons.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><img style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14);border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/Sell_Zonn_Station.webp\" width=\"800\" height=\"324\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[rSk7eibyzUUCKOvI]{1 - 1 - Sell Zonn Station}</p>\n<p>The interior of the space station conforms to the Imperial standard. Since <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> orbits a<strong> Core World</strong>, it is far better maintained than other structures of its age, and the main areas see constant renovations and repairs. However, a few steps off of the beaten path quickly reveal that the station is rotting from the inside out. A short walk away from the main venues leads to decrepit sections of the station, filled with broken lights, tarnished metal walls, missing deck plates, and all manner of suspicious aliens that have been driven out of the nicer sections by the Empire.</p>\n<p>Aboard <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>, all doors and walls are made of metal and conform to the standard statistics for objects. Slicing the station’s central computer system has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>27</strong> and the computer will <strong>trace any failed slicing attempt</strong> to the terminal from which it was made. The station’s information terminals can be found at regular intervals throughout public areas and in private rooms. These terminals can provide basic information on the layout and facilities of the station, but not much else. Each terminal is connected to the central computer system.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing boarding and supply services, <strong>Sel Zonn Station </strong>is host to a number of businesses that cater specifically to travelers. All shopkeepers on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> sell at the prices listed in the <em><strong>Player's Handbook</strong></em>. Almost all shops are located on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, though a few are off the beaten path. Some of the most popular establishments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gundark’s Cantina:</strong> Owned and operated by a gruff Human male named <strong>“Gundark” Saff</strong>, <strong>Gundark’s Cantina </strong>is a place where people from all walks of life can come to relax. Though <strong>Gundark </strong>himself shows some anti-alien bias, he does not prevent non-Humans from patronizing his establishment. As such, it is a popular meeting place for nearly anyone on the station, and it features a large number of secluded booths for private conversations.</li>\n<li><strong>The Credit Chip:</strong> A local casino that attracts a wide variety of patrons, the <strong>Credit Chip </strong>is operated by a quiet and brooding Human named <strong>Cecil Vane</strong>. <strong>Vane </strong>doesn’t like what the Empire has done to the station, especially since they don’t take it too well when he cheats Imperial officers out of their money. The most popular games in the galaxy, including <strong>sabacc </strong>and <strong>pazaak</strong>, see a lot of play here.</li>\n<li><strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong>: A corporate medical practice and pharmaceutical supplier, <strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong> provides care to those who can afford it. The chief doctor in the practice is <strong>Byra Fenn</strong>, a talented Human woman with secrets to keep. <strong>Dr. Fenn</strong> has had extensive dealings with one of thestation’s information brokers, a protocol droid named <strong>@Actor[ZdBVinS88aV4I5c2]{Switch}</strong>, and she owes him several favors.</li>\n<li><strong>Mechanical Allies: </strong>A droid repair and sales shop, this is one of the few businesses run by a non-Human that hasn’t been hut down by the Empire. Operated by an untrustworthy Twi’lek named <strong>San</strong>, <strong>Mechanical Allies</strong> sells all manner of droid parts and reconditioned droids. Despite the fact that most of his droids are faulty, <strong>San </strong>has remained in business thanks to his own savvy and his ability to buy off the Empire from time to time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two primary sources of law enforcement aboard <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. The Empire has a moderate presence, with a garrison aboard to keep the peace and enforce Imperial law. In addition to <strong>stormtroopers </strong>and <strong>Imperial officers</strong>, <strong>Brentaal’s</strong> <strong>planetary security force</strong> keeps a watchful eye on everything that happens on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. The planetary security force gets along well enough with the Empire, though questions of jurisdiction have caused tension between the two in the past. For the most part, the planetary security force operates out of the local security office, where it keeps a number of cells open for criminals and malcontents. Those captured by the Empire, however, are incarcerated in the security office briefly before being transported via shuttle to the planet’s surface. Customs enforcement is relatively light simply because large cargo haulers cannot dock with the station. As such, usually only a single customs officer is on hand for any cargo inspection.</p>\n<p>The main commercial area of<strong> Sel Zonn Station</strong> is known as the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Filled with shops of all kinds, as well as large, open seating areas with fountains, plants, and other decorations, the <strong>Promenade </strong>is where <strong>Brentaal’s </strong>nobles and other station visitors go to enjoy themselves. Security is tight on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, and Imperial forces are on hand at all times to keep the peace. Additionally, the Empire tries to keep the area free of aliens, and as such they harass any non-Humans moving about the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Although they won’t go so far as to arrest anyone, they often try to start fights with aliens just to have an excuse to lock them up. For this reason, most non-Humans tend to stay clear of the <strong>Promenade</strong>, except on rare occasions.</p>\n<h2>First Contact</h2>\n<p>When <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit </strong></em>opens, the heroes are congregating (either together or by chance) in the <strong>Promenade</strong>, where their destinies await them. It is a typical day on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, with a slightly sparser crowd than usual. When the heroes arrive, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>The Promenade is filled with the bustle of revelry and commerce. Spilling out of the gambling halls are the sounds of victory and the moans of defeat, while the music of local bands issues from the cantinas. Only a handful of citizens mill about in the main areas of the Promenade, a few gazing out the massive windows at the planet Brentaal hovering below. Businesspeople hawk their wares to the passersby, and a few security officers make their way down the main avenue of the Promenade on their usual patrol at a leisurely pace.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After the heroes have had a moment to soak in the sights and sounds of the <strong>Promenade</strong>, give them each a chance to make a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong>. Those who succeed on the roll notice two men loitering on the <strong>Promenade </strong>who do not appear to be part of the larger crowd. Each seems to be scanning the crowd closely as though looking for someone, though they pay no attention to the heroes. Those who succeed on the <strong>Perception</strong> check with a roll of <strong>15 or higher</strong> also notice that, despite wearing normal traveling clothes, each man is carrying a hold-out blaster tucked into his jacket, and both men are wearing identical garments. Those who succeed on the check with a <strong>20 or higher</strong> also notice that both men seem to be whispering to themselves, obviously speaking into hidden comlinks.</p>\n<p>Within moments, a slender woman wearing the greasy clothes of a mechanic stumbles down the <strong>Promenade</strong>. Though she is trying to hide it, she has clearly been wounded somehow, and she looks disheveled. Once the heroes have had a chance to see the woman, the two men make their way toward her, and she turns and runs toward the nearest hero (or toward the heroes who are closest to one another). She pleads for assistance, offering credits to anyone who will help her. The two men give chase, and the first encounter begins.</p>\n<p>The woman is <strong>@Actor[PKG5ljbdBqdilzmz]{Maya}</strong>, an <strong>Alderaanian </strong>Security agent, and the men are undercover informants for the Empire.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Promenade Shootout - CR 1</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[NZtcLz9CyaHxic9s]{1-01 Promenade Shootout}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the heroes subdue the Imperial informers and defeat the security officers, they must quickly get to safety before reinforcements arrive. If the heroes did not manage to save <strong>Maya</strong>, a datapad she carries contains notes on “<strong><em>V14</em></strong>” and “<em><strong>Switch</strong></em>” as clues to the location of some valuable cargo. The heroes should be able to make <strong>Investigation checks</strong> to learn what those words mean. A successful <strong>DC 10 check</strong> reveals that <strong>V14</strong> is a deep storage bay on the station. A successful <strong>DC 15 check</strong> reveals that information, plus the fact that <strong>Switch </strong>is a well-known droid information broker that operates from a secret location within the station. The heroes should be able to figure out that something important (and possibly profitable) is going on, and they should be on the right track to discover <strong>V14’s secrets</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes keep <strong>Maya </strong>from being killed in the fracas, she directs them to safe quarters where they can talk. She is still grievously wounded and has <strong>four levels of exhaustion</strong> that can be removed only with surgery or a dip in a<strong> bacta tank</strong>. However, despite her injuries, she tells the heroes enough to set them on the right path. They need to get to <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, where a droid named <strong>Switch </strong>can provide them with the location of some very valuable cargo. According to <strong>Maya</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> was responsible for receiving and storing this cargo, which was shipped all the way from the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. <strong>Maya </strong>was supposed to contact <strong>Switch</strong>, recover the cargo, and deliver it to <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Senator Bail Organa}</strong><strong> </strong>of <strong>Alderaan</strong>. She reveals that she is a member of <strong>Alderaanian Security</strong> and part of <strong>Organa’s </strong>personal security detail, and that she was waylaid by the Empire mere hours after arriving on the station. Apparently, the fact that she works for a vocal opponent of the Emperor has flagged her as a troublemaker, and the Empire wants her off the station one way or the other.</p>\n<p>If the heroes agree to help her further, <strong>Maya </strong>assures them that <strong>Bail Organa</strong> will be happy to reward them for their efforts, and she emphasizes that the work they are helping her with could save the lives of many innocent beings. She doesn’t go into more detail than that, but she assures the heroes that her mission advances the cause of good. If the heroes can procure the cargo from <strong>Switch</strong>, she will provide them with transport from<strong> Sel Zonn Station </strong>to <strong>Alderaan</strong>. Unfortunately, due to the recent confrontation, the heroes will need to keep a low profile, and <strong>Maya </strong>herself must remain safe in her quarters until fully healed.</p>\n<p>If the heroes take her up on her offer, <strong>Maya</strong> entrusts them with directions to bay <strong>V14</strong> and tells them to contact her when they procure the cargo.</p>\n<h2>Deep Storage Bay V14</h2>\n<p>If the heroes want to learn more about the <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, they can do so in a variety of ways. Any informational computer terminal on the station can confirm that bay <strong>V14</strong> is on a level that is off limits to non-Imperial personnel. If the heroes attempt to access further information on <strong>V14 </strong>it can be obtained with the <strong>Technology skill</strong> at a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>15</strong>. A successful <strong>check </strong>reveals that bay <strong>V14</strong> is in a section of the station that has been quarantined for over a year and a half, yet no maintenance requests have been made for repairs to that section. Additionally, the terminal reveals that <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong> is located along one of the station’s primary exhaust systems, meaning that exhaust conduits should be running right through the storage bay.</p>\n<p>An <strong>Investigation check </strong>regarding storage bay <strong>V14</strong> has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>10 </strong>and counts as learning local news or rumors. Success reveals that despite the fact that <strong>V14 </strong>is in a quarantined zone, a large number of aliens are often seen going into that zone. Rumor has it that the aliens operate some kind of criminal organization out of that section of the station, and that a contingent of Gamorreans is always on guard near the deep storage bay.</p>\n<p>An attempt to learn secret information about bay <strong>V14 </strong>has a <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>20 </strong>and reveals that since the quarantine was put into place, the station manager has been taking bribes to keep it that way. The bribes are delivered to the manager on a monthly basis by an <strong>unsavory-looking Twi’lek</strong>, and though the Empire doesn’t like it, the local security forces ensure that Imperials never get too close to the quarantined areas.</p>\n<p>When the heroes finally arrive in the vicinity of <strong>deep storage bay V14</strong>, they find that they have entered a very neglected part of the station. Many of the lights have burned out, and blaster marks and carbon scoring mar the walls, ceiling, and floor. The area reeks of ozone and electrical fires, and pools of coolant litter the hallways at regular intervals. After winding their way through a near-labyrinth of decrepit corridors, the heroes come upon bay <strong>V14</strong>, which is guarded by a pair of <strong>Gamorreans </strong>wielding vibro-axes. (Use the generic <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Thug}</strong> statistics on page 44 of the <em><strong>SW5e Monster Manual </strong></em>for the <strong>Gamorreans</strong>.)</p>\n<p>If the heroes approach openly, the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>take no hostile actions and seem concerned only with blocking the doors. If the heroes approach stealthily, the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>are not likely to notice and seem more interested in conversing in their grunting language than in watching for outsiders.</p>\n<p>If the heroes attempt to persuade the guards to let them in to see <strong>Switch</strong>, they might find it easier than they suspect. Provided that the heroes do not attack them on sight, if the heroes make a successful <strong>DC 11 Persuasion check</strong>, the guards let them inside. A bribe of at least <strong>50 credits</strong> grants the heroes a <strong>+5 circumstance bonus</strong> on any <strong>Persuasion checks</strong> against the guards.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter bay <strong>V14</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>The deep storage bay is as run-down as the hallways leading up to it, with entire metal plates missing from the floor and a huge, open exhaust shaft near the back of the room. Large crates litter the area, creating the appearance of a haphazard mess, and the air has a distinct smell of sweat and fumes that makes the entire area unpleasant. Flickering lights provide modest illumination, and a burst pipe along the ceiling leaks blue fluid down one wall.</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em>Near the center of the room is an item that seems very out of place — a large, finely crafted desk made of Japor ivory wood, which means that the desk is both priceless and rare. Sitting peacefully behind the desk is a protocol droid with shiny, ebony coverings that seem to soak up light and offer only the slightest reflection. The droid’s eyes flicker slightly, as though imitating a person blinking rapidly.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At first glance, <strong>Switch</strong>, the protocol droid information broker, appears to be the only occupant of the storage bay, but several of his thugs and associates are also spread throughout the room. Three <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Bodyguards} </strong>hide behind crates scattered around the room, and the heroes can make <strong>Perception checks</strong> (opposed by the<strong> thugs’ Stealth checks</strong>) to notice them. Additionally, <strong>Switch’s </strong>most valued companion - a blue-and-red astromech droid with the designation <strong>R5-B8</strong> - beeps and burbles quietly beside the protocol droid, seemingly lost in its own world. Lastly, <strong>Switch’s </strong>majordomo, a <strong>@Actor[QoleTei4axaIwqJC]{Twi'lek Thug}</strong>, stands quietly off to one side, not actively hiding but also not clearly visible until the heroes approach the desk.</p>\n<h3>Meeting with Switch</h3>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[ZdBVinS88aV4I5c2]{Switch}</span></strong> is a curious protocol droid that has clearly gone a long time since his last memory wipe. A self-fashioned information broker and budding crime lord, <strong>Switch </strong>has aspirations to sophistication that are likely remnants of his protocol droid programming. With a male personality and a Coruscanti-Imperial accent, <strong>Switch </strong>could fit in among <strong>Brentaal’s </strong>nobility if he were not a droid. When he speaks, he does so cheerfully and lightly, as though his power and prestige leaves him without a care in the world. It is unclear how a protocol droid managed to convince a number of living beings that he should be their leader, but the fact that the thugs follow <strong>Switch</strong> loyally is a testament to his persuasive skills and his acumen as a crime lord.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in bay <strong>V14</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> greets them warmly and welcomes them to his domain, regardless of how they enter. Even if the heroes killed the <strong>Gamorreans </strong>to get inside, <strong>Switch </strong>seems unfazed. As a protocol droid, he has no concept of the fragility or the value of life, a fact that makes him both easy to get along with and incredibly dangerous. After introducing himself and<strong> @Actor[cNjMiBv8BiJ5nvSy]{R5-B8}</strong>, <strong>Switch </strong>offers the heroes a drink from his extensive collection of beverages; for a droid that does not consume, he has exceptionally refined tastes. Once his guests have been made comfortable, <strong>Switch </strong>explains that his services are available to anyone who can pay, and he implores the heroes to tell him why they have come.</p>\n<p>The heroes have several challenges throughout their encounter with <strong>Switch</strong>, though only one is critical to the ongoing plot of the adventure. They must convince the droid to reveal the location of the cargo he is keeping for <strong>Maya </strong>and to turn that cargo over to them. The following encounter challenges demonstrate how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter:</p>\n<h4>Critical Challenge</h4>\n<p>The heroes need to get their hands on whatever cargo <strong>Switch </strong>is holding for the Alderaanian Security officer, <strong>Maya</strong>. If they can make a <strong>DC 17 Persuasion check</strong>, <strong>Switch </strong>acknowledges that he is holding cargo for <strong>Maya </strong>but does not tell them where. If they manage to get <strong>Switch </strong>talking, however, their options expand greatly.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Switch </strong>has been persuaded to admit possession of <strong>Maya's </strong>cargo, he is willing to accept payment to release it to the heroes. For the “<em><strong>eminently reasonable</strong></em>” sum of <strong>1,000 credits</strong>, they can take the cargo wherever they wish. If the heroes don’t have that much money, or if they don’t want to spend that much, <strong>Switch </strong>is willing to accept less, provided that one or more of the heroes agrees to supply him with information on a regular basis from wherever their travels may take them. Each hero who agrees to this deal reduces the required payment by <strong>200 credits</strong>. Of course, the heroes can agree with no intentions of sending information to <strong>Switch </strong>in the future, but doing so might have dire repercussions. (Any such consequences are beyond the scope of this adventure, but feel free to include your own adventures and enemies later in the campaign.) On the other hand, the heroes might like the idea of working for a droid crime lord, even indirectly, which can open up plot hooks of its own.</p>\n<p>Once <strong>Switch </strong>is satisfied, he reveals that the cargo is in the <strong>main docking bay on Blue Deck</strong>, a section of the station heavily traveled by Imperial loyalists and one of the few places where Imperial ships dock. If the heroes fail to convince <strong>Switch </strong>to give them the cargo, they might have another chance to succeed; see the development section of “<em><strong>Arrival of Ganga Lor</strong></em>” (below).</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 1</h4>\n<p>Whether or not <strong>Switch </strong>agrees to turn the cargo over to the heroes, he does not freely volunteer the nature of the valuable goods. However, a simple bribe of <strong>50 credits</strong> is enough to get him to reveal the secret. The cargo is, in fact, <strong>another agent</strong> of Alderaanian Security who has been <strong>frozen in carbonite</strong> for transport from the<strong> Deep Core</strong> world of <strong>Empress Teta</strong>. The agent had himself frozen so that he could be transported as cargo rather than as a passenger, reducing the chance that the Empire would find and arrest him.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 2</h4>\n<p>After learning that they will be obtaining a person <strong>frozen in carbonite</strong>, the heroes might press <strong>Switch </strong>for more information on why the agent was smuggling himself from <strong>Empress Teta</strong>. This information requires a bribe of <strong>200 credits</strong>, which the droid accepts only if the heroes were able to persuade him. If the bribe is paid, <strong>Switch </strong>reveals that the Alderaanian Security agent was spying on the Empire’s secret interests in the<strong> Deep Core</strong>. In the months since the rise of the Empire, hundreds of warships have sealed off the few known trade routes into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>, only allowing wealthy Imperial loyalists in or out of that region of space. Over the last few months, the Empire has set up the <strong>Deep Core Security Zone</strong>, and <strong>Emperor Palpatine</strong> himself has overseen the transfer of large amounts of resources and nobles loyal to the Empire into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>. The <strong>frozen security agent </strong>had been scouting one of the dozens of worlds that the Empire had discovered during its recent expansion into the <strong>Deep Core</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 3</h4>\n<p>In addition to the possibility of working for <strong>Switch</strong>, the heroes have a chance to make the droid a permanent contact and ally in the <strong>Core Worlds</strong>. If the heroes managed to persuade him, <strong>Switch </strong>is open to the idea of providing information the heroes need, wherever they may be. However, convincing <strong>Switch </strong>that this is a good idea is a bit more difficult. A down payment of <strong>500 credits</strong> is enough to convince the droid that a deal is in his best interests. Other kinds of compensation work as well, provided that any items offered have a market value of roughly <strong>500 credits</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 4</h4>\n<p>Once the heroes convince <strong>Switch </strong>to turn over <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo, they also have the opportunity to make a bit of a profit. In addition to the cargo he is holding for <strong>Maya</strong>, <strong>Switch</strong> has a crate of bottles of Corellian ale that is bound for <strong>Alderaan</strong>. If, over the course of their conversations with the protocol droid, the heroes mention that they have access to a ship, <strong>Switch </strong>offers them a small fee to deliver the ale to <strong>Alderaan</strong>, with the promise of <strong>500 additional credits</strong> on delivery. The Corellian ale is stored in the same docking bay as the frozen security officer, in a crate that can be carried by a single person. If the heroes agree to deliver the crate, they can do so without complications once they arrive on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. The credits will be sent to an account that <strong>Switch </strong>sets up on <strong>Alderaan</strong>, from which the heroes can easily retrieve their payment.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p>If the heroes successfully negotiate with <strong>Switch</strong> for the <strong>frozen Alderaanian Security agent</strong>, award them experience points as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 2 opponent</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Arrival of Ganga Lor</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have concluded their business with <strong>Switch</strong>, an unexpected visitor arrives. If the heroes left the <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> alive, they now die squealing amid a hail of blaster bolts, which can easily be heard from inside bay <strong>V14</strong>. Bursting into the room is <strong>@Actor[qGw8StGUCpTJCd2i]{Ganga Lor}</strong>, a Chevin gangster, and a handful of his thugs. When he pushes his way into the room, <strong>Ganga Lor</strong> shouts in Basic, “<em><strong>So you thought you could hide your deal with the offworlders from me, droid? I’m tired of not getting my cut! Turn him into a scrap heap, boys!</strong></em>” With that, <strong>Ganga Lor’s</strong> thugs attack <strong>Switch </strong>and the heroes, who are now caught up in a gang fight.</p>\n<h2>Ganga Lor’s Grudge - CR 3</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[7vPUSWkX2A6AXumu]{1-02 Ganga Lor’s Grudge}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p><strong>Switch </strong>is most grateful for the heroes’ assistance in the fight. If they had not yet convinced the droid to turn over <strong>Maya’s</strong> cargo, he agrees to do so now (otherwise, he agrees to one of the auxiliary challenges free of charge). Additionally, if the heroes need medical attention, he promises to call in a favor with <strong>Dr. Fenn</strong> of <strong>Delgas Medical Supplies</strong> to get them treated free of charge.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Switch </strong>does not survive the encounter, the heroes can learn the location of <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo by slicing into the computer in his desk (<strong>DC 18</strong>).</p>\n<p>When the encounter with <strong>Switch</strong> is concluded, the heroes can head to <strong>Blue Deck’s</strong> main docking bay and retrieve the cargo.</p>\n<h2>Blue Deck</h2>\n<p><strong>Blue Deck</strong> is one of the nicest and most dangerous sections of <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong>. Reserved almost exclusively for Imperial loyalists and off-duty personnel, <strong>Blue Deck</strong> is a combination of luxury and fanatical devotion to the Empire. Everything on <strong>Blue Deck </strong>is pristine and well maintained, with none of the technical problems seen elsewhere on the station. Propaganda posters for <strong>Emperor Palpatine</strong> cover the walls, and the insignia of the Empire is found almost everywhere the eye can see. <strong>@Actor[LtlZ2iNX2RaN85CP]{Security Officers} </strong>guard every entrance and exit to <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, and while they examine everyone closely, they make no move to stop anyone from coming or going - at least, not often.</p>\n<p>The anti-alien bias encountered on the <strong>Promenade </strong>is even worse here. Shopkeepers steadfastly refuse to serve non-Humans, and <strong>cantina bouncers</strong> prevent them even from entering the establishments. Very few aliens walk the halls of <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, and those that do are usually servants or slaves of nobles and Imperial agents.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the turbolift doors slide open and you step out onto Blue Deck, it is like entering a wholly different space station. The floors are polished and possess a metallic sheen, and the massive windows along one wall grant the most magnificent view of Brentaal available on the station. Maintenance and service droids flit about from one place to the next, keeping everything clean and ordered.</em></p>\n<p><em>Moving about the halls of Blue Deck are large numbers of Humans, most of them wealthy by all appearances. They pay little attention to the few aliens found in the area, except, perhaps, to sneer as they pass.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When the heroes reach <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, they might head directly to the <strong>main docking bay</strong>, which is fine but leaves them ignorant of developments in the hangar bay. If the heroes take the time to make a <strong>DC 10 Investigation check</strong> to retrieve local news and rumors, they discover that the Empire has just sent an entire squad of <strong>security officers </strong>to the main docking bay to check out some suspicious cargo. If the heroes do not try to make an investigation check, they can learn the same information by making a successful <strong>DC 20 Perception check </strong>to overhear two nobles talking about the situation.</p>\n<h3>Skig Banos, Imperial Informant</h3>\n<p>As the heroes make their way across <strong>Blue Deck</strong>, they see a face that might be familiar. Any heroes who managed to notice the two Imperial informants on the <strong>Promenade</strong> before <strong>Maya </strong>approached them now also notice a similarly dressed man on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>. In fact, any hero who succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Perception check </strong>realizes that this man was on the <strong>Promenade</strong> earlier but fled at the first sign of blaster fire. The man is <strong>@Actor[QncwLbC3mZYETt2S]{Skig Banos}</strong>, an Imperial informant and world-class coward. With a mop of greasy black hair and a physique that is little more than skin hanging off bones, <strong>Skig </strong>looks a bit on the pathetic side. His beady eyes and oversized nose give him a more sinister edge, causing him to resemble a wild womp rat eager to escape captivity.</p>\n<p>If the heroes confront <strong>Skig</strong>, he immediately tries to escape. If the heroes manage to stop him without making too much of a ruckus, they should be able to interrogate him and get a bit more information about what is going on. <strong>Skig </strong>is too afraid of being harmed by the heroes to raise an alarm, and though he acts unfriendly at first, a successful <strong>DC 17 Persuasion check</strong> can make him more amenable. Similarly, a successful<strong> DC 12 Intimidation check</strong> can make him more helpful.</p>\n<p>If either of these <strong>checks </strong>succeed, <strong>Skig</strong> is willing to tell the heroes almost anything so that they will let him go. This includes lying to them - he makes<strong> Deception checks </strong>every round at <strong>+2</strong> until caught in a lie - and<strong> Skig’s</strong> lies include that <strong>the Empire has discovered them</strong>, that<strong> the Empire has killed Maya</strong>, and that he’s <strong>just a merchant out for a walk</strong> on <strong>Blue Deck</strong>. An indifferent <strong>Skig </strong>simply wants to get away, and he does everything he can to escape without getting killed or raising an alarm. Truthfully, <strong>Skig </strong>is equally scared of the Empire and fears that they will betray him at any time.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Skig</strong> can be made friendly, he actually volunteers useful information. He knows that the Imperials were recently tipped off about contraband in the<strong> main docking bay</strong> (by one of <strong>Ganga Lor’s</strong> toadies looking to make a few quick credits, though <strong>Skig </strong>doesn’t know that) and have gone to investigate. He saw at least three <strong>security officers</strong> and their <strong>sergeant</strong> head toward the docking bay, though he thinks there may be more in the bay. Additionally, <strong>Skig </strong>saw them moving a repulsor sled into the main docking bay, meaning that they have some heavier weapons at their disposal. With this information in hand, the heroes should be a bit better prepared for the fight ahead of them.</p>\n<h3>Main Docking Bay</h3>\n<p>The <strong>main docking bay</strong> on <strong>Blue Deck</strong> is used by the Empire to ferry cargo and personnel from the station to the surface of <strong>Brentaal </strong>and back. <strong>Switch </strong>managed to get <strong>Maya’s </strong>cargo stored here by calling in some favors, reasoning that the Empire would not think anyone would be bold enough to hide contraband right under their noses.</p>\n<p>The <strong>main docking bay</strong> is a large, open area with a control room and two side storage rooms.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Frozen Goods - CR 3</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[2IE4GDrB8C3EB0Ag]{1-03 Frozen Goods}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>Once the heroes obtain the <strong>agent frozen in carbonite</strong>, it quickly becomes time to get away from the Imperial presence on<strong> Sel Zonn Station</strong>. If the heroes managed to save <strong>Maya</strong>, she awaits their call on the comlink and sends one of her allies to pick them up. A short <strong>5 rounds</strong> after the heroes call <strong>Maya</strong> for assistance, a large Baudo-class Star Yacht named the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>drifts into the main docking bay and lowers its ramp. Over the loudspeaker, the ship’s captain, a woman named <strong>@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Sirona Okeefe}</strong>, calls out to the heroes that <strong>Maya </strong>sent her to fetch them. When the heroes all board the ship, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> blasts off from <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> and makes a quick jump to hyperspace, headed for <strong>Alderaan</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes did not save <strong>Maya</strong>, you (the GM) have several options. The heroes might have met <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> previously on the <strong>Promenade</strong>, or she might have been referred to them by <strong>Switch</strong>, who knew that they would need transport off the station. Failing that, the heroes might need to take their cargo and find a place to hide on the station until they can hire passage to <strong>Alderaan </strong>or stow away on a ship. Regardless, the heroes should take the <strong>frozen agent</strong> to <strong>Alderaan </strong>as quickly as possible.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note:</strong> escaping <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Rendezvous on Alderaan</h2>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes should make their way to <strong>Alderaan </strong>to rendezvous with<strong> Bail Organa</strong>. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> can take the characters to meet with the <strong>Senator</strong>, and she encourages them to relax and recuperate during the journey to the peaceful planet of <strong>Alderaan</strong>. Feel free to use this time to allow the heroes to return to full health and take care of anything they need to do during the trip through hyperspace. The journey to <strong>Alderaan</strong> goes off without a hitch, and as the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> soars over the planet, the heroes enjoy a great view of the beautiful landscape of the world. Any heroes near the cockpit overhear <strong>Aldera’s spaceport control tower </strong>clearing the ship to land at the <strong>Royal Palace’s </strong>landing pad.</p>\n<p>When the heroes disembark, they are immediately greeted by several <strong>Alderaanian honor guards</strong> and one of <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> <strong>servants</strong>, who escorts them into the palace and to the <strong>Grand Hall</strong>—an ornately decorated chamber where the royalty of <strong>Alderaan </strong>holds court. The heroes are given refreshments and asked to wait on <strong>Organa’s </strong>arrival. During this time, the <strong>Senator’s servants</strong> unload the precious cargo from the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>and set about releasing the <strong>Alderaanian Security agent </strong>from the carbonite. The heroes aren’t kept waiting long; <strong>Senator Organa</strong> arrives soon.</p>\n<h3>Meeting with Bail Organa</h3>\n<p>The encounter with <strong>@Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Bail Organa}</strong> should be short and should set the heroes on the path that will carry them throughout the <em><strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong></em> campaign. The meeting should impress upon them the magnitude of their discovery. To be invited into the palace of an Imperial Senator and famous diplomat like <strong>Bail Organa</strong> is something that most citizens can only dream about, and the discussion that follows is all the more remarkable for the simple fact that the <strong>Senator’s </strong>power can shape the lives of billions.<strong> Be sure to emphasize the gravity of the situation</strong> and how exceptional it is for a <strong>Senator </strong>to request the aid of unknowns.</p>\n<p>When the heroes have made themselves comfortable in the palace, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The doors to the Grand Hall open, and in strides a middle-aged man who has a well-kept goatee and is wearing Senatorial robes. Easily recognizable as Bail Organa, he smiles and nods to the servants before turning to you. “Welcome to Alderaan,” he says. “I had hoped we might meet under more pleasant circumstances, but unfortunately the Empire makes almost everything unpleasant. Still, I am glad to see that the... difficulties at the spaceport above Brentaal didn’t impede you too much.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I’ve asked you to join me today because the agents of mine that you rescued seem to think you can be trusted.

Nothing large—just a small garrison where they could keep prisoners out of the way. Some months ago, I was contacted by an Imperial Admiral who was disillusioned with the way the Empire had twisted the once-great Republic, and he began feeding me sensitive information. A little over a week ago, that communication stopped. My agents tell me that the Admiral has been taken to Felucia, where he is being held against his will.

Here are some possible answers to likely questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who is this admiral? </strong>“<em>Admiral Gilder Varth is a veteran of the Clone Wars and an honorable man. He commanded one of the ships at the Battle of Coruscant and was promoted for bravery. His loyalty to the Empire seemed unwavering, but once you’ve seen what he has seen . . .</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What kind of opposition will we face? </strong>“<em>The Imperial presence on Felucia is light. The facility itself is a secret, so they do not advertise its presence with large numbers of troops. Our knowledge of the facility’s existence is our greatest advantage. Additionally, you shouldn’t be going anywhere near the planet’s major cities, so you should be able to travel largely undetected.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What is Felucia like? </strong>“<em>Dense overgrowth, huge fungi, and massive creatures are the order of the day on Felucia. It’s a wild, untamed planet, and you should be careful to avoid much of the local wildlife.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s in it for us? </strong>“<em>Each of you will receive 2,000 credits, and if things go well, I will guarantee more work when you return. Additionally, if the Admiral has as much information as I believe he does, this could be an excellent chance to strike a blow at the Galactic Empire.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sirona Okeefe and the <em>Banshee</em></h2>\n<p>If the heroes agree to discover the fate of<strong> Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Senator Organa</strong> tells them that he has arranged transport aboard a vessel owned and operated by one of his longtime friends. <strong>Sirona Okeefe</strong> is a free trader and transport pilot who frequently works for <strong>Organa </strong>and his agents — most recently, <strong>Maya</strong>. On retainer from the <strong>Senator</strong>, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is a beautiful middle-aged woman who knows her way around the galaxy. For the first arc of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, her modified Baudo-class Star Yacht, the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>, will serve as the heroes’ primary mode of transportation. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is fiercely loyal to <strong>Senator Organa</strong> and trusts the heroes only because he does.</p>\n<p>The <strong>captain</strong> is something of a black sheep in her family (which hails from <strong>Brentaal</strong>) and doesn’t care to speak about her past. She does mention that she has a niece who aspires to follow in her footsteps. Otherwise, <strong>Okeefe </strong>always keeps the conversation light and flirty. <strong>Captain Okeefe </strong>is also very fond of her droid copilot, an <strong>RX-13 </strong>pilot droid nicknamed “<em><strong>Crash</strong></em>,” who is curmudgeonly and prefers to gripe about nearly everything rather than go about his duties. Still, the two make a good pair — the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> runs smoothly and has a number of special modifications that make it more than a match for Imperial patrols.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/sirona%20okeefe/sirona_okeefe_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"473\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@JournalEntry[d6pPqVXtgSLj9jvM]{07 - Handout 7 - Sirona Okeefe}</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Sirona Okeefe}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[FosVtZziT8sp1hFP]{RX-13, AKA \"Crash\"}</strong></p>\n<h3>The Banshee</h3>\n<p><strong>@Actor[DuuwF8UYgQsQ7NgL]{Banshee}</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/Baudo-Class_Star_Yacht.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"671\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LLB1oXwD6dkBwClH]{03 - Handout 2 - The Banshee}</p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The first and second are a gas giant and a toxic ocean, respectively, and an <strong>asteroid belt</strong> separates them from the rest of the system. The third planet is <strong>Centares,</strong> the fourth is another gas giant, the fifth is <strong>Nizon,</strong> the sixth is barren, and the seventh is yet another gas giant. Fragments from the <strong>asteroid belt</strong> have spread throughout the system, such that several worlds (including <strong>Nizon)</strong> are surrounded by <strong>asteroid rings</strong> and clouds of dust and debris. The clouds are thickest as they reach the upper atmosphere of these worlds, wreathing them in dirty halos. The clouds are not solid, however, and a few thin pathways through them allow access to the planets.</p>\n<p>When the heroes drop out of hyperspace in the <strong>Centares</strong> system, they find the Imperial presence not so much lessened as moved. There aren’t many Imperial ships around <strong>Centares,</strong> which is the only official reason for anyone to be here. However, there is a surprising amount of activity around <strong>Nizon.</strong> Assuming that the heroes jumped out of hyperspace near <strong>Nizon</strong> (their ultimate destination), a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> can pinpoint the ships that remain around <strong>Centares—a</strong> Venator-class Star Destroyer with a half complement of starfighters and its escorts, and two Dreadnaught-class heavy cruisers. The forces around <strong>Nizon</strong> are more extensive.</p>\n<p>If a deployed operator makes a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>, read the following information.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Chatter over the transceiver reveals additional ships in the system.

A few other ships, including bulk carriers and personal starships, are flying about in the planet’s atmosphere, below the dust cloud.</em></p>\n<p><em>At least one ship still orbits Centares, maintaining an Imperial presence there. From the sound of the chatter, it’s another old Star Destroyer design, though perhaps a bigger design.

Any effort to scan the surface visually or listen to incoming communications reveals that there is only one major city on the whole planet. When the heroes begin to examine the city or look for a place to land, read the following text.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The city is a major metropolis, but it’s also the only big city you find anywhere. You can see starship traffic, proving that the city has a spaceport—most likely, the only one on the planet. The city is built on a flat, rocky region between a large mountain and rough badlands of valleys and hills. There is construction on the mountain overlooking the city, but from here it’s impossible to tell exactly what’s being built.</em></p>\n<p><em>Starship traffic is regular enough to suggest the presence of more than just Imperial forces and the local population. A few small freighters, manufactured by numerous different companies, are landing or taking off. Given that they lack any sign of Imperial markings or identification broadcasts, they are probably privately owned, meaning that at least a few members of other species will be found in the city, making it easier for you to move around there.</em></p>\n<p><em>Though they are nowhere near you, you pick up transceiver broadcasts from patrols on the far side of the city. If you want your ship to remain undiscovered, you’ll have to make some effort to conceal it once you land.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge:</strong> The heroes must prevent their ship from being spotted by Imperial ground patrols or <strong>V-wing</strong> flyovers. The high level of dust and poor visibility will help, but additional action is required.</p>\n<p>Have the players make a <strong>Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> to conceal the ship, keep track of this <strong>check.</strong> Each <strong>day,</strong> allow local patrols to make a <strong>Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> with at <strong>+5</strong>. On any successful <strong>check,</strong> the <strong>starship</strong> is found and placed under guard (until the Empire is forced to withdraw from the system). In the first fight to take place on the <strong>day</strong> their ship is discovered, the heroes face an additional <strong>crab droid</strong> from <strong>Vril Vrakth’s</strong> forces. The <strong>crab droid</strong> carries something that it took from the heroes’ ship, which was used by <strong>Vrakth</strong> to guess their plans.</p>\n<p>Many caves and valleys can be used to conceal their ship, but getting into these locations is tricky at best. If the heroes’ ship has crashed, the caves and valleys aren’t an option. If the heroes land under their own power, they can try these difficult landing spots. A valley landing requires a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> and gives <strong>disadvantage</strong> on any <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> to find the ship. A <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> allows the heroes to land deep in the back of a cave, which ensures that no one will find their starship for at least several days (which should cover the timeframe of the adventure). Characters might wish to rig some kind of tarp or wall to hide their starship, constructed from local material or appropriate camouflage they bring with them. Doing so will also grant <strong>advantage</strong> to any <strong>Wisdom (Survival) checks</strong> to hide the ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge: Nizon</strong> is an inhospitable planet. Visibility on the surface is limited, the native dust makes it difficult to breathe without assistance, and it’s easy to get lost. Since the heroes are unlikely to have landed within sight of the city, they must make their way there from the outer reaches of the badlands without being spotted or getting lost. Doing this successfully requires a <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong>. If one or more heroes does not have a breath mask of some kind, the <strong>DC of the Survival check</strong> increases by <strong>5</strong>. On a failed <strong>check,</strong> the heroes either get lost or are forced to take cover from the worst of the dust, losing a <strong>day</strong> of travel time. This increases the chances that their <strong>starship</strong> is discovered and that they’ll encounter <strong>crab droids</strong> deployed by <strong>Vrakth.</strong> If the heroes take more than <strong>two days</strong> to reach the city, they run into one <strong>crab droid</strong> in the badlands each <strong>day</strong> until they make it to the city.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> Though inhospitable, <strong>Nizon</strong> is not lifeless. Tough and dangerous predators prowl the rough badlands and hunt the recessed valleys. The most dangerous of these is the <strong>blade scorpion</strong>, a massive creature that combines the worst traits of a crab and a spider. The Nazren fear these beasts and never travel alone in regions where they are common. The creatures are one reason that the bounty hunter <strong>Vrakth</strong> chooses to employ <strong>crab droids</strong> on the world.</p>\n<p>Each <strong>day</strong> that the heroes are in the badlands (including their <strong>first day</strong>), make a <strong>Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> from a <strong>Blade Scorpion</strong> against the worst <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong> of any hero in the group. If the <strong>Blade Scorpion's</strong> <strong>check</strong> is higher, it picks up their scent and attacks.</p>\n<p>The statblocks for the crab droid and Blade Scorpion are below.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[n98G5HxIjcyYiPhX]{LM-432 \"Muckraker\" Crab Droid}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[4rpAv6BwT2iDm6Rs]{Blade Scorpion}</strong></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[vH0L5dRT5wRAx4uR]{01 - Handout 1 - Crab Droid Checklist}</p>\n<h2>The City</h2>\n<p>The city of the <strong>Nazren</strong> has no name. None is needed, as it is the only settlement larger than a town on the entire planet. The <strong>Nazren</strong> refer to it as <strong>ahdjok,</strong> but this is nothing more than their word for <strong>“city,”</strong> and the Empire hasn’t bothered to assign it a name. Its position behind <strong>Mount Antas</strong> protects the city from the worst of the planetary dust, and it has a large, flat area on which to build a spaceport. As a result, the city has been the main point of contact between the Nazren and offworlders. It sits atop an underground river, which provides an endless supply of fresh water. This, combined with offworld trade, allowed the city to grow much larger than local agricultural conditions would otherwise permit. It is a traditional pilgrimage site for Nazren worldwide, making it a convenient location for the Empire to gather slaves.</p>\n<p>The city is sprawling, with <strong>10-</strong> to <strong>15-story buildings</strong> crowded around wide streets and public fountains. Most of the city looks old, constructed of stone and natural caverns. Ancient statues of rock and ornate decorative carvings are worked into most buildings, and even the roads are paved with carved stones. More modern constructions can also be seen, mostly watch-posts bolted onto buildings or gates that block access to some streets. Posters, wanted signs, and recruitment fliers for the Empire have been plastered everywhere, ugly debris atop the city’s natural charm.</p>\n<p>Most of the creatures you see are obviously locals, the Nazren. None seem to carry weapons, not even something as crude as a knife or club. Their heads are generally downcast and their shoulders slumped, but whenever one glances at an Imperial poster or flyer, it looks up, and a flash of hatred shows briefly in its eyes.</p>\n<p>Though much less common, aliens from dozens of worlds also walk through the streets. Most are followed by one or two Nazren carrying heavy bundles of goods. The aliens go by without comment and are diverse enough that you see no reason your own appearance should draw unwanted attention.</p>\n<p>The Imperial presence here is also obvious. <strong>Stormtroopers</strong> in small groups patrol openly through the city, and in the distance you can hear the mechanical stomp of military walkers, though nothing as big as an <strong>AT-AT</strong> would fit in the streets.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge:</strong> Now that the heroes are in the city, they need to learn what’s going on and what they can do about it.</p>\n<p>The easiest option is to make an <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>. A result of <strong>10 </strong>to <strong>14</strong> reveals that the Empire took control of the city about a year go and has been shipping <strong>Nazren</strong> off as <strong>slaves</strong> ever since, mostly with <strong>Trandoshan slavers.</strong> It also reveals that any Nazren who resists the Empire is placed in a <strong>detainment camp</strong> in the center of town, and thus, most <strong>Nazren</strong> leaders are now in that camp.</p>\n<p>A <strong>check</strong> result of <strong>15</strong> to <strong>19 </strong>also reveals that many <strong>Nazren</strong> are prepared to fight back as soon as they receive a signal from <strong>Sartok,</strong> a <strong>Nazren</strong> leader recently arrested and thrown into the <strong>detainment camp.</strong> However, the Empire doesn’t realize that <strong>Sartok</strong> is anyone special.</p>\n<p>A <strong>check</strong> result of <strong>20</strong> or more also reveals that a bounty hunter named <strong>Vril Vrakth</strong> has recently arrived on <strong>Nizon</strong> with a collection of old <strong>crab droids.</strong> Most people think that <strong>Vrakth</strong> is hunting <strong>Sartok</strong> (which is true), but they note that he keeps asking about newcomers, and that he seems to have the aid of Imperial troops. Many believe that <strong>Vrakth</strong> is chasing an Imperial bounty on a <strong>non-Nazren</strong> target (which is also true; the <strong>Zabrak</strong> was hired by <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> to find the heroes).</p>\n<p>A hero could also attempt to gain this information from an<strong> Imperial administrator</strong> or <strong>slaver</strong> by making a <strong>Charisma (Deception) </strong>or <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. The <strong>DC</strong> for either is only <strong>12,</strong> and reveals the same amount of information as a result of <strong>10</strong> to <strong>14</strong> for the<strong> Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>With a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>, a hero can slice into the local datastreams and pick up broadcasts from Imperials and Nazren insurgents (with the same results as the <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> The oppression the <strong>Nazren</strong> suffer is obvious, and patrols of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> march through the streets. At a dramatically appropriate point, the heroes see <strong>six heavy</strong> <strong>stormtroopers</strong> kick down the door of a building and drag a screaming <strong>Nazren</strong> mother out of the house. If the heroes do nothing, the mother is hauled off, and the cries of a <strong>Nazren</strong> child can be heard within the structure.</p>\n<p>If the heroes fight the <strong>stormtroopers,</strong> the real challenge is to be fast and quiet. If the heroes defeat the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> silently or in <strong>1</strong> or <strong>2 rounds</strong>, no one reports the fight. If the fight is noisy and lasts for <strong>3 or more rounds</strong>, someone calls more <strong>stormtroopers.</strong> A squad of <strong>six</strong> more arrives in <strong>2 minutes</strong>, a group of <strong>12</strong> arrives in <strong>5 minutes</strong>, and an <strong>AT-ST</strong> arrives in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. use the <strong>Heavy Trooper</strong> statblock from <em><strong>Scum and Villainy</strong></em> for these <strong>troopers.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>6 @Actor[W9pYyeBKnSyRCaZ6]{Heavy Troopers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[LLxezY3EqvHI9H7r]{AT-ST}</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to keep mother and child together, give them <strong>inspiration</strong> as a bonus. If the mother is saved, she says that <strong>Sartok</strong> will wish to talk to the heroes, but she is too fearful to answer questions about the resistance leader, other than to choke out <strong>“detainment camp.”</strong> She then runs off to go into hiding.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Nazren</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Nazren</strong> are tall humanoids, approximately the same height as <strong>Wookiees,</strong> but broader at the shoulders and narrower at the hip, with longer arms and torsos but shorter legs. They are hairless, with thick skin that has a heavy hide or leather look. They are brown to light yellow in color, a natural camouflage for their dust-bowl world. The head of a <strong>Nazren</strong> has no nose and is flatter than a Human's. A prominent brow ridge protects their eyes, and a series of small knobs start at the back of the head and run down to a visible spine.</p>\n<p><strong>Nazren</strong> wear sleeveless tunics tucked into black hide pants and heavy boots. Their clothes are normally fastened with hooks or clamps on the end of short lengths of cord or attached belts.

They are welcome to rest and recuperate aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, but their mission is not yet finished.</p>\n<p>When the players eventually make it to <strong>Bespin,</strong> they find it a far more hospitable environment than either <strong>Felucia </strong>or <strong>Cato Neimoidia.</strong> Though <strong>Cloud City</strong> has not yet reached the prominence it will enjoy under <strong>Lando Calrissian</strong> years later, it is still a wealthy settlement where entrepreneurs have made small fortunes for themselves. When the players drop out of hyperspace, <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> Message to Spacers instructs them to contact spaceport control to request permission to land. Additionally, the message advertises the upcoming <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong>—the players’ first hint that there is a big event coming up.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of the people on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> the spaceport controllers are looking to make a few extra <strong>credits</strong> here and there. When the players (or <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> if she is still ferrying the players around) contact the spaceport, they are told that “<em><strong>as a result of heavy tourist traffic from the sabacc tournament, each ship will be assigned a landing priority.</strong></em>” The spaceport authorities assign the players a landing priority that would make them wait close to <strong>12 hours</strong> to land. Fortunately, a little diplomacy and a few <strong>credits</strong> can easily grease the wheels of bureaucracy and get them a higher priority. Offering a bribe of at least <strong>300 credits</strong> is enough to let the players land within the <strong>hour,</strong> and the controllers are able to electronically transfer the funds directly from the players’ accounts if they so desire.</p>\n<p>Arrival on <strong>Cloud City</strong> is unlike arrival on most other worlds. The approach path given by the spaceport controllers takes the players on a beautiful tour of the city, obviously meant to show off the planet’s wealth, and finally brings the players in to land at one of the many civilian docking bays glimpsed on their approach. When the players disembark, they find several <strong>Cloud City</strong> customs officials waiting on them. Though they bear no Imperial insignia, they seem to hold themselves with the same self-assured arrogance that agents of the Empire always display.</p>\n<p>The customs officials demand the right to thoroughly search the ship for contraband, a statement that sends <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> into a sputtering fury. She argues vehemently with one of the customs agents, while two others watch placidly. If the players intervene, the situation can be defused calmly in a number of ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Credits</strong> seem to be the grease in the wheels of <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> bureaucracy, and offering a bribe of <strong>500 credits</strong> for each of the three customs agents <strong>(1,500 credits</strong> in total) causes them to “waive the needless inspection” for the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em></li>\n<li>Attempting to smooth talk or intimidate the agents is also possible, as each customs agent is little more than a low level bureaucrat with little real authority. Have the players make a <strong>DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Intimidate)</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of the resolution to the customs shakedown, the players should come away with two important pieces of information that can help them in this adventure: <strong>credits</strong> can accomplish almost anything on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and security has been tightened up as a result of the upcoming <strong>sabacc tournament</strong>. In fact, security is so tight that the customs officials have one more duty before departing, a duty that no amount of <strong>bribery</strong> or <strong>diplomacy</strong> can overcome. No lethal weapons are allowed in the main areas of <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and the players must agree to leave any weapons other than <em>hidden blades</em>, <em>small daggers</em> or <em>batons</em> on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em> Of course, players can always attempt to hide their weapons from the customs officials using a <strong>DC 16 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>, but the penalty for discovery with a weapon is to have the weapon confiscated and the perpetrator forcibly removed from <strong>Cloud City</strong>. Later, the players will have a chance to gain some exemption from these restrictions, but for the first part of the adventure, they must either hide their weapons or leave them on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/MCQ-cloudcity.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"267\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[zKSEx8J3qkJZFZAi]{02 - Handout 2 - Cloud City}</p>\n<h2>Cloud City</h2>\n<p><strong>Cloud City</strong> is a beautiful tourist city that also serves as a major mining outpost for the collection and spin-sealing of <strong>Tibanna gas,</strong> which is used in <em>blaster</em> weapons. When walking through the corridors of the city, the players are treated to beautiful vistas of the gas giant <strong>Bespin,</strong> and architecture designed to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Most of the residents of <strong>Cloud City</strong> are Humans, though occasionally the players will see a handful of Ugnaughts walking close to one another in tight packs. The Ugnaughts seem to keep to themselves and are mostly ignored by the Humans.</p>\n<p><strong>Cloud City</strong> <strong>Wing Guards</strong> (the security forces of <strong>Cloud City</strong>) stand watch over most of the major thoroughfares in the city, and rarely is one very far from the players. Many of the businessmen and nobles walking through the corridors of the city have their own security escort, but they seem to pay no attention to the players, regardless of their appearances or species. Most residents on <strong>Cloud City</strong> are too concerned about their own wealth or recreation to spend much time worrying about galactic politics, and there is no visible Imperial presence in the city.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Cloud City Wing Guard</strong> keeps a close eye on anyone acting suspicious, especially this close to the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> They are always on the lookout for someone possessing weapons, but in order to maintain a pleasant atmosphere for the tourist trade, they rarely shake down visitors unless there is a clear reason to do so. The atmosphere in the city is one of buzzing anticipation, as the <strong>tournament</strong> has drawn visitors from all corners of the galaxy, as it does every year. The players are likely to learn that the <strong>tournament</strong> is just <strong>days away</strong>, and that hundreds of players have already arrived to buy into the event.</p>\n<h2>A Few Wrong Questions</h2>\n<p>Once the players have made their way through customs, their most likely course of action is to seek out <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. Knowing that he was headed to <strong>Bespin</strong> in his personal luxury yacht, the players will want to know whether he is here, and if so, where the slimy <strong>Hutt</strong> is hiding. The most straightforward method is to make <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong>, but regardless of the <strong>check </strong>results, the information provided is always the same: no one has seen or heard from<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Most citizens don’t know the first thing about the <strong>crime lord,</strong> and they seem affronted that the players would suspect them of associating with criminal types.</p>\n<p>Digging deeper turns up few leads. Computer-savvy players might try to break into the <strong>Cloud City</strong> computer system to see if any record of <strong>Darga’s </strong>arrival is in the spaceport logs. The city’s central computer system is one of the most sophisticated central computers in existence. The computer is unfriendly to anyone who accesses it from a location other than a designated high-security area providing a <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Slicer's Kit) check</strong>, but if the players manage to sneak into or break into a <strong>Wing Guard security post,</strong> they can access the central computer with a friendly attitude providing a<strong> DC 22 Intelligence (Slicer's Kit) check</strong>. However, even this much effort proves mostly fruitless. The players discover a spaceport log entry for the arrival of a luxury yacht called the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot,</strong></em> whose port of origin is registered as <strong>Cato Neimoidia,</strong> but the docking information seems to have been erased, with no ability to retrieve it. Though the players will probably suspect that <strong>Darga </strong>is on <strong>Cloud City</strong> (no departure information was given for the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot),</strong></em> they have no idea where the ship is. With all of the luxury vessels arriving at <strong>Cloud City</strong> for the <strong>tournament,</strong> finding a specific yacht is going to prove nearly impossible, and the players should realize that doing so could take <strong>weeks</strong> even under the best of conditions.</p>\n<p>If the players become discouraged at their difficulties (as they likely will), an event unfolds that should give them hope. When they make contact with <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> she tells them that a message was delivered electronically to the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> addressed to them. The message simply states, “<em><strong>If you are wise, you will stop asking so many questions. It is a long drop through the clouds, and enemies of the Hutt have a bad habit of vanishing.</strong></em>” <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> tells the players that her droid copilot, <strong>Crash,</strong> has managed to trace the message back to a computer terminal in one of the more industrial areas of <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and can give them directions using the city’s map if they want to find the person who sent the message</p>\n<h2>The Parliament of Guilds</h2>\n<p>Following the directions they received from <strong>Captain Okeefe,</strong> the players leave the tourist areas of <strong>Cloud City</strong> and begin descending into the industrial sector. Humans become less and less common, and Ugnaughts outnumber other species almost two to one in these areas. The directions lead the players to an office marked “<em><strong>Parliament of Guilds— Sector U357,</strong></em>” which appears to be little more than a bureaucratic office. Inside, the players find nearly a dozen Ugnaughts working behind desks and at computer terminals. When the players enter the Parliament office, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the door to the office slides open, over a dozen Ugnaughts look up from computer terminals or end conversations with one another abruptly. There is a long moment of silence as the Ugnaught workers all turn their eyes toward you. Breaking the silence, one of the Ugnaughts squeals and grabs another by the coat, shaking his comrade roughly.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I told you they would find us!” the Ugnaught shouts. “You’ve brought them down on us, all because of your meddling! They will kill us for sure!”</em></p>\n<p><em>The second Ugnaught, fighting desperately to break free of his companion’s grasp, cries out pleadingly. “We don’t know that they work for the Hutt! Maybe they could help us.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After struggling with each other for a few more moments (or less, if the players intervene), the two Ugnaughts separate, and the first turns to the players, begging for his life. He introduces himself as <strong>Krygg</strong> and explains that they meant no harm with the message. His shaken companion, who identifies himself as <strong>Fyren,</strong> tells the players (in a much less fearful tone) that they noticed the players snooping around after <strong>Darga </strong>and figured that they might be enemies of the <strong>Hutt.</strong> Rebuking <strong>Krygg</strong> for his spinelessness, <strong>Fyren</strong> invites the players to join him in his office. The two Ugnaughts escort the players to a very small, cramped office (built for Ugnaught-sized inhabitants), where they explain further exactly what happened.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/fyren%20and%20krygg/fyren_and_krygg_art.webp\" width=\"544\" height=\"419\" /></p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[gz0MvuZfeieRs27U]{12 - Handout 12 - Fyren and Krygg}</strong></p>\n<p>According to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> ever since <strong>Darga</strong> set up his ancillary operation in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> it has caused no end of trouble for the Ugnaughts, particularly those involved in the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>, <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> ruling body. When <strong>Darga</strong> first set up shop in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> he began bribing a number of Ugnaughts working for <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> (the company responsible for all <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> exports from <strong>Bespin)</strong> in order to siphon off some of the spin-sealed <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> for sale on the black market. When <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> discovered the missing <strong>Tibanna gas,</strong> they began taking their complaints to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>. Knowing that the Ugnaughts were responsible for the missing gas, but not knowing which ones, the <strong>Parliament</strong> had no choice but to issue tougher restrictions on all Ugnaughts. Over time, the situation has degenerated to the point where the Ugnaughts’ reputation is close to being ruined.</p>\n<p><strong>Fyren</strong> explains that, when they noticed the players searching for <strong>Darga</strong>, he sent them a message to dissuade them from seeking the <strong>Hutt</strong> further. <strong>Fyren</strong> says that he was just trying to stop them from getting too involved in dealings with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> but <strong>Krygg</strong> accuses his companion of leaving a trail for the players to follow, hoping they would come to assist. <strong>Fyren</strong> admits that he finds it fortunate that the players have come, and if they will help the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> root out the Ugnaughts on <strong>Darga’s </strong>payroll, he and <strong>Krygg</strong> will provide information that could help them in their search for the missing <strong>Hutt.</strong> The Ugnaughts explain that they were considering dealing with their criminal comrades themselves, but they believe that the players are more suited to (and likely more experienced in) dealing with those in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ. <strong>Fyren</strong> explains that they don’t necessarily want the players to kill the Ugnaughts that <strong>Darga </strong>has bought, but that such losses would be understandable if the players found no peaceful way to resolve the situation.</p>\n<p>If the players agree to the exchange, the Ugnaughts share one piece of information with the players in good faith—they know that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with the Empire, and they believe that a transaction is about to take place. If the players take care of their problem, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> agree to share the rest of what they know. To get them started, the two Ugnaughts tell the players that they have tracked the source of the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> being sold on the black market to one of their gas storage areas in the bowels of the city. They give the players directions for getting there, but they also provide a warning: The <strong>Wing Guard</strong> rarely goes into those depths, so the players will be on their own down there.</p>\n<h2>Discovering the Bought Ugnaughts</h2>\n<p>Following the directions given to them by <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> the players can make their way to one of the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage areas. When they enter the storage area, read the following description aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The air is damp, and the acrid smell of smoke is thick here. The corridors are cramped, clearly designed for workers of smaller stature, and heavy machinery, some of it rusting and extremely aged, litters the area. The sound of metal-on-metal is almost deafening in places, and many of the machines look corroded and covered in a green-tinted sludge, byproducts of the Tibanna gas spin-sealing process. Unlike the rest of the city, this area seems more like an aging factory than a luxury resort.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage chambers are unguarded, though the players eventually stop seeing anyone—Human or Ugnaught—moving through these corridors well before they find who they are looking for. When the players move into a spin-sealing chamber, allow them to make <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> to hear over the sound of the heavy machinery that lies ahead. Those who succeed overhear a grunting conversation between several Ugnaughts. Any players who speak the Ugnaught language can tell that there are workers ahead, arguing with one another over the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to siphon from a shipment going out this afternoon. They are clearly working with machinery as well, and the sounds fill the corridor almost completely.</p>\n<p>If the players approach cautiously and are not spotted, they can see further evidence that they have found their quarry. The Ugnaughts have connected a small pump to one of the massive <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> storage tanks (which is clearly labeled in <strong>Basic, Bocce,</strong> and a <strong>dozen other languages</strong>) and are transferring the gas into dozens of smaller containers, each small enough for an Ugnaught to carry.</p>\n<p>If the players try to talk to the Ugnaughts, they are wary, beginning with an unfriendly attitude toward the players. Having been caught doing something illegal—not to mention being in the employ of a Hutt <strong>crime lord</strong>—they are extremely paranoid about outsiders. However, if the players are not initially hostile, the Ugnaughts avoid going for their weapons. The boss, clearly the ringleader of this gang of thieves, believes that the other Ugnaughts on <strong>Cloud City</strong> are too set in their ways and doesn’t believe that they would lift a hand against him. If the players pursue any reasonable course of discussion (including using <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> or <strong>Charisma (Deception) checks</strong>), feel free to let the situation develop naturally. <strong>Bribery</strong> is <strong>unlikely</strong> to work; the Ugnaughts know that they wouldn’t be able to spend the <strong>credits</strong> if the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> or <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> got its hands on them. The Ugnaughts are unwilling to turn themselves in to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong>, and if there is any hint that the players are there to facilitate such a turn of events, the encounter can turn hostile in a hurry.</p>\n<h2>Tibanna Gas Refinery</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[qovIBmWwWpfYHkYX]{3-01 Tibanna Gas Refinery}</strong></p>\n<p>After the players have dealt with the Ugnaughts in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ, they can return to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> to complete the transaction. If the players brought some or all of the Ugnaughts to the <strong>Parliament of Guilds</strong> without killing them, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> are extremely pleased and thank the players for helping to restore some of the reputation their people had lost. If all of the offending Ugnaughts were killed, <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg</strong> are saddened, but they agree that sometimes unsavory steps must be taken.</p>\n<p>Regardless, the players learn the rest of what the two Ugnaughts know about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings on <strong>Cloud City.</strong> According to <strong>Fyren</strong> and <strong>Krygg,</strong> the <strong>Hutt</strong> has long been taking the Tibanna gas siphoned from <strong>Figg &amp; Associates</strong> and selling it to the Empire. The transactions are usually discrete, and they have been unable to learn what <strong>Darga</strong> gets out of the deal. However, they know that the next transaction will take place during the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> <strong>Fyren</strong> suggests that the players visit the <strong>Yerith Bespin hotel</strong> (one of the finest in the city) or the Royal Casino (where this year’s tournament is to be held). Though the Empire rarely makes itself known on <strong>Cloud City,</strong> so many strangers have arrived in the last few days that almost anyone, including Imperial agents, could be involved in the tournament.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Dealings</h2>\n<p>Having learned about the exchange between <strong>Darga’s agents </strong>and the Empire that will take place during the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament,</strong> the players will likely set out to explore the locales mentioned by the Ugnaughts. If they investigate the <strong>Royal Casino</strong>, they find that the entire establishment has been closed down in preparation for the tournament, and several <strong>Wing Guards</strong> block anyone from entering. From the outside, the players can see workers and technicians inside the casino, working diligently to make sure that every table is spotless, every <strong>sabacc dealer droid</strong> is functioning, and every room is well lit.</p>\n<p>At the <strong>Yerith Bespin,</strong> however, the players have a bit of good fortune. As they enter the lobby of the hotel, they hear a loud argument between a Human male and one of the desk workers. Everyone in earshot can hear the man complaining that his accommodations are unsatisfactory, and he demands that the hotel manager put him in a better room. Though the desk worker is doing his best to calm the man, the customer continues his arrogant tirade, heedless of how many people are watching. When the players enter the hotel lobby, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The opulent </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Yerith Bespin</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> hotel is decorated extravagantly and is clearly one of the finest establishments in the galaxy. Beautifully woven carpets stretch from one side of the lobby to another, and crystalline chandeliers hover overhead, casting scintillating light down on the guests below. To one side of the room, a row of fine wooden desks house computer terminals for hotel employees, each of whom is helping finely dressed guests check in. One guest, however, seems to be taking issue with the service and is berating the hotel employee tending to him so loudly that everyone in the lobby has turned to stare. The Human man, dressed in the style of Core nobility, speaks with a precise accent even as he shouts at the desk worker, complaining about how unsuitable he finds the accommodations.</span></em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As the players approach, allow them to make a<strong> Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>with the information learnt based on the <strong>DC</strong> of the <strong>check,</strong> as shown below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 10:</strong> Just across the lobby, a small entourage of <strong>four Humans</strong> and <strong>two Theelin women</strong> (near-Humans with colorful hair and skin patterns) waits patiently for the shouting customer to air his complaints.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 15:</strong> The <strong>two Theelin </strong>are watching the man’s every move carefully and seem to be scanning the room looking for threats at the same time—clearly, they are <strong>bodyguards</strong> of some sort.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 20:</strong> The <strong>four Humans </strong>are all very similar; in fact, they could be <strong>quadruplets</strong> and are distinguished only by the scars they bear. Any player noticing this may make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> with a success revealing the four men to be clones from the same stock as the <strong>clone troopers</strong> who fought for the Republic in the Clone Wars, but a bit older than the party might expect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After a few moments, the argument at the desk subsides, and the <strong>nobleman</strong> seems to be mollified. He briskly strides over to the <strong>clones</strong> and his <strong>bodyguards</strong> and begins issuing orders in hushed tones while the hotel staff rushes off, apparently to see to his requests. The <strong>noble</strong> gathers his party and stalks off into the streets of <strong>Cloud City.</strong></p>\n<p>Hopefully by now, the players have realized that this <strong>noble</strong> has Imperial connections, and as such could lead them to more information about the Empire’s deal with <strong>Darga</strong>. If the noble or his <strong>bodyguards</strong> suspect that they are being followed, they react with hostility. Likewise, if the players approach the <strong>noble</strong> with questions about the Empire or <strong>Darga</strong>, he orders his <strong>bodyguards</strong> to deal with the unwanted intruders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/baron%20kithriss/baron_kithriss_art.webp\" width=\"400\" height=\"566\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[idCsylLrWydAtH2X]{03 - Handout 3 - Baron Kithriss}</p>\n<h2>Imperial Threats</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[rJGowrXQOXO6q9Bx]{3-02 Imperial Threats}</strong></p>\n<p>Once the players have dealt with the <strong>noble</strong> and his <strong>guards,</strong> they can learn a good deal about who he is and why he is in <strong>Cloud City</strong> from a <em>datapad</em> on his person. The <em>datapad</em> contains travel logs that identify him as <strong>Baron Kithriss,</strong> a wealthy noble from <strong>Chandrila.</strong> The logs show that prior to coming to <strong>Bespin,</strong> he spent a great deal of time on a political retreat in the <strong>Deep Core,</strong> seemingly at <strong>Palpatine’s</strong> behest. <strong>Baron Kithriss’s</strong> <em>datapad</em> includes instructions to meet up with his “retainers” (the <strong>clone troopers)</strong> and travel to <strong>Bespin,</strong> securing accommodations at the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> hotel and awaiting further instructions. Moreover, he is to let no one know that he is an agent for the Empire, and he must maintain complete communications silence except to receive instructions on his hotel computer. The <strong>Baron</strong> has his hotel <strong>access card</strong>, and savvy players should realize that they can use the <strong>card</strong> to gain access to his <strong>suite</strong> in the <strong>Yerith Bespin,</strong> granting them <strong>luxurious rooms</strong> for the duration of their stay and allowing them to intercept the <strong>Baron’s</strong> instructions from the Empire. Since he has been instructed to remain silent, they need not fear anyone noticing the <strong>Baron’s</strong> untimely disappearance.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Yerith Bespin Hotel</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> is one of the oldest and finest hotel establishments on <strong>Cloud City.</strong> Every room is spectacularly appointed, and it’s easy to imagine that only hotels on <strong>Coruscant</strong> are nicer. If the players stay in the <strong>Yerith Bespin,</strong> their every need is addressed by the hotel staff, and they can spend their downtime enjoying almost any luxury activity found in upscale hotels throughout the galaxy. You can use the accommodations as a reward for the players’ diligence up to this point in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. The hotel is significantly nicer than the accommodations in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, and it beats trudging through the jungles of <strong>Felucia</strong> by a wide margin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note:</strong> Gaining access to the <strong>Yerith Bespin Hotel</strong> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The buildings adjacent to busier skylanes have shields that are constantly engaged, while buildings farther from the traffic patterns have shields that are activated only at the last moment before a crash. In either case, the shields have a partial cushioning effect to minimize damage to the speeder. Any collision that happens only deals <strong>half damage</strong> to the speeder.</p>\n<p><strong>Crowded Skylane:</strong> Busy skylanes pose a <strong>hazard</strong> to speeders traveling at a much greater rate of speed or in a different direction. These vehicles are mobile <strong>hazards</strong> and require a <strong>DC 21 Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> to avoid a large vehicle or a <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (Piloting)</strong> for a huge vehicle (GM's choice.) On a failed <strong>check,</strong> the airspeeder scrapes across another vehicle taking <strong>5 ([[/r 1d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]] damage</strong> for a large vehicle or <strong>11 ([[/r 2d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]) damage</strong> for a huge vehicle.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhaust Vent:</strong> A massive exhaust vent spews a huge jet of steam into the air. This provides <strong>full cover</strong> for speeders passing through or along the jet.</p>\n<p><strong>High-Speed Dive or Ascent: </strong>High-speed dives or climbs typically are not allowed on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> as they are extremely dangerous and run counter to the <strong>skylane</strong> patterns. Passing through a <strong>skylane</strong> in this manner increases the chances for a collision, increasing the <strong>DC</strong> of an <strong>Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> made to avoid a collision by <strong>2</strong> (See <strong>Crowded Skylane</strong> above)</p>\n<p><strong>Light Beams:</strong> Extremely bright beams of light shine up from the lower levels or from a nearby building. These beams do not cross a major <strong>skylane;</strong> however, speeders traveling in open airspace may encounter them. When crossing through a beam, there is a chance that the pilot could be <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.XNjuuloYOfesNbbZ]{Blinded}</strong> temporarily. This also applies to any character who can see directly out of the front windscreen. The pilot of a vehicle must make a <strong>DC 18 Constitution saving throw</strong> and on a failed <strong>save</strong> becomes <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.XNjuuloYOfesNbbZ]{Blinded}</strong> until the end of its next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Skybridge: </strong>Skybridges, pipes, and other <strong>hazards</strong> that span the space between buildings require <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Piloting) checks</strong> to navigate, a failed <strong>save</strong> dealing <strong>22 ([[/r 4d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]) damage</strong> as the speeder collides with such a <strong>hazard.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Skytunnel: </strong>Skytunnels allow speeders to pass through massive buildings and are treated as crowded skylanes (see above). Building shields protect the sides of the tunnel (see above).</p>\n<p><strong>Speeder Truck Convoy:</strong> The heroes may attempt to hide among a passing convoy of massive airspeeder trucks or bulk freighters descending from orbit, or they might use the convoy as <strong>cover.</strong> If attempting to <strong>hide,</strong> the pilot must make an <strong>Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong>, opposed by the pursuer’s <strong>Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. Additionally, a collision in the convoy may trigger a chain reaction accident.</p>\n<p><strong>Surface Power Coupling:</strong> If the heroes wish to attempt to use a <strong>substation power coupling</strong> against their pursuer (as Zam did against the Jedi in Episode II), they must first descend to the same level as the coupling, then make a successful <strong>ranged attack</strong> against the coupling (<strong>AC 20</strong>). The resulting charge forces any pursuing vehicle and its occupants to make a <strong>DC 18 Constitution saving throw</strong> or take <strong>22 ([[/r 4d10[lightning] # Lightning damage]]) damage</strong>, taking <strong>half damage</strong> on a success.</p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"h6V92xwfULM4U654","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"LBlyEEHvoZi0DEBE","name":"Part 2: Darga's Palace","content":"<h2>Part 2: Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have subdued <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, it is not hard to convince him to lead them to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>. The Devaronian is clearly terrified of what awaits him at the <strong>palace</strong>, but he is also afraid of the heroes, and as such he does not make any escape attempts. <strong>Raden </strong>has a speeder that can fit three passengers (or six, if they pile in on top of one another), and he wastes no time in zooming through the bridge city, weaving in and out of ruined buildings and taking shortcuts through the rubble. The trip to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> takes <strong>half an hour</strong>, and <strong>Raden’s </strong>winding course leads the heroes into a dense cluster of buildings that blocks out their view of the Cato Neimoidian sky.</p>\n<h2>Darga's Court</h2>\n<p>As the heroes approach <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, they see that it is cleverly hidden among the ruins of several destroyed Neimoidian palaces. In fact, on first approach, there seems to be nothing of importance in the area. But on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong> is cobbled together from former Neimoidian estates. The entrance to the <strong>palace </strong>is a pair of massive blast doors, <strong>5 meters tall </strong>and carved with elaborate Hutt runes, set into the front wall. The doors appear to be unguarded.</p>\n<p><strong>Raden </strong>walks timidly up to one door, which has a small communications panel. He presses a button, sputters some phrases in Huttese (“<em><strong>This is Raden. I’ve come to deliver news to the mighty Darga. With all due respect, I require an audience.</strong></em>”), and steps back, fidgeting nervously. A long, quiet moment passes before two <strong>Nikto</strong> with <em>hunting blaster rifles</em> appear on battlements above the doors, weapons at the ready and pointed down at the visitors. A metal panel in the blast door scrapes as it is pulled aside, and a pair of glowing red eyes appear in the slit. A gravelly voice echoes from within the doors, again in Huttese (“<em><strong>You’re in for it now, Raden. Darga is expecting visitors, all right, but those creatures are not them.</strong></em>”), and the panel slams closed. A moment later, there is a heavy clank of metal on metal, and the blast doors part to either side. A rush of cold, dry air flows outward from the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong>, and <strong>Raden </strong>motions the heroes to follow him inside.</p>\n<p>Entering the <strong>palace</strong>, there is no sign of who or what might have owned the glowing red eyes seen through the door panel. (They belong to <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the Neimoidian majordomo, though the heroes won’t learn that until later.) The heroes follow <strong>Raden </strong>down a long, dark hallway illuminated at seemingly random intervals by torches set in sconces on the walls. Anyone passing through this hallway, including the heroes, feels that something is watching them from the darkness. Unmarked metal doors are set into the walls at various points, and the air is thick with the smell of dust and rotting wood.</p>\n<p>Moving deeper into the <strong>palace</strong>, the heroes get the sense that the building was once bright and beautiful. Any character who makes a successful<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check </strong>can tell that much of the architecture and trim is Neimoidian in design, and it becomes clear that the <strong>palace </strong>probably once belonged to a high-ranking member of the Trade Federation, perhaps an advisor to <strong>Nute Gunray.</strong> Eventually, <strong>Raden </strong>leads the heroes toward the soft sound of music and voices, which come from the Hutt’s <strong>throne room.</strong> When the heroes arrive in the room, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Darga’s throne room is both opulent and repulsive. A thick layer of oddly scented smoke drifts through the air, rising out of braziers in the corners of the room. Once-beautiful tapestries line the walls, though most of them have been torn, burned, or stained to the point that they are almost unrecognizable. A raised dais in the center of the room supports the massive bulk of Darga the Hutt, and behind his dais a large, open balcony seems to extend into darkness.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/darga%20the%20hutt/darga_the_hutt_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"562\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[PQG318qeXuISSNPf]{02 - Handout 2 - Darga the Hutt}</p>\n<p>When <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> leads the heroes into the room, the sounds of conversation and music come to a halt. Silence reigns as every eye turns to watch <strong>Raden </strong>lead the visitors into an open space in front of the opulent dais. <strong>Darga’s </strong>eyes roll from the heroes to <strong>Raden</strong>, then sharpen quickly with anger. He booms something in Huttese at the Devaronian (“<em><strong>What is the meaning of bringing outsiders here?</strong></em>”), who immediately begins groveling, begging for the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> forgiveness as the rest of the court hoots with laughter and derision. <strong>Darga </strong>cuts him off with a harsh word (“<em><strong>Silence!</strong></em>”) and calls for his protocol droid, <strong>TC-663</strong>. From this point on, <strong>Darga </strong>begins addressing the heroes directly, using<strong> TC-663</strong> as a translator.</p>\n<p><strong>Darga’s </strong>giant eyes rest on them all for a long moment before the <strong>Hutt</strong> demands to know why they have come to his <strong>palace </strong>and how they convinced <strong>Raden</strong> to escort them. <strong>Darga </strong>is satisfied with any answer that is not confrontational. He really isn’t looking for trouble with the heroes; he just wants to feel them out and see if they could be useful in some way. He’s already impressed with their ability to locate his hidden <strong>palace </strong>(though it may not seem like much of a feat, there are many in <strong>Darga’s </strong>own organization who couldn’t manage it) and wants to discover whether they have any skills that he could exploit.</p>\n<p><strong>Darga </strong>begins this encounter <strong>indifferent</strong> to the heroes. If they can shift his attitude to <strong>friendly</strong> through a <strong>DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) </strong>or<strong> Charisma (Deception) check</strong>, he welcomes them into his court. Any flattery grants the heroes <strong>Advantage </strong>on <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong> to alter the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> attitude, as do bribes or gifts of any kind. If the heroes mention that they are seeking employment or are interested in providing their services, they gain <strong>Advantage</strong> on <strong>Charisma (Deception) checks</strong> against the crime lord. <strong>Darga </strong>is still building up his power base and is always on the lookout for potentially valuable members of his organization. If the heroes fail their <strong>Persuasion check</strong> to join the court, they can still join by offering bribes or other incentives, though <strong>Darga </strong>expects at least <strong>1,000 credits’</strong> worth before he even considers it.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes have satisfied his curiosity, <strong>Darga </strong>invites them to join him at court for a short while. He has many matters to attend to over the next <strong>few days</strong>, and he is expecting visitors besides, but he is more than happy to let them stick around. <strong>Darga </strong>plans to impress the heroes with his wealth and power, hoping to convince them that a business relationship would be profitable. This is exactly the kind of thing the heroes need to get close to the <strong>Hutt</strong> and snoop around. If the heroes agree to remain at the <strong>palace</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> calls for a feast and offers them a large amount of delicious (and expensive) food and drink. As the feast begins, two of <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> drag <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> off to the dungeons so that he can “<em><strong>think about his betrayal.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>During the feast, <strong>Darga </strong>asks many questions about the heroes: who they are, where they come from, what their exploits are, and so on. He also gives them a chance to ask questions, but he graciously deflects any questions about his business practices for now. He lets one thing slip, however—if the heroes mention the Empire, <strong>Darga </strong>boasts that one of the visitors he is expecting is an <strong>Imperial agent</strong>. The <strong>Hutt</strong> seems to think that this will impress the heroes, though he reveals little more than the fact that the Empire is sending a delegate to his court sometime in the next <strong>few days</strong>.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the meal, the heroes get the impression that, while <strong>Darga </strong>is trying to win them over with his opulence, he is also testing to see whether they have anything to offer him. He drops hints with remarks such as, “<em><strong>We will see how you enjoy your time in my court—and how much I enjoy your company,</strong></em>” or “<em><strong>The next few days will give us a chance to get to know each other and see how much I have to offer you—and you to offer me!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note:</strong> gaining entry to <strong>Darga</strong> <strong>the Hutt's</strong> <strong>Palace </strong>should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Members of Darga the Hutt’s Court: At least twelve Gamorrean guards</strong>,<strong> three bounty hunters</strong>, <strong>three Quarren assassins,</strong> <strong>TC-663</strong> (Also called <strong>Six-Six</strong>),<strong> Igren Demos</strong> and other assorted beings. Full statistics blocks for some of these characters appear in the following encounters.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[tE0urkjMN4ltuEr8]{Darga The Hutt}</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Encouraging the Heroes</strong></p>\n<p>During the scenes in Darga’s court, you should encourage the heroes to get involved in the various encounters by reminding them of their mission. When they enter the palace, they know very little about the Hutt’s involvement with the Sarlacc Project, and they should be eager to follow up on most leads. Encourage the heroes to take any opportunity to impress Darga, reminding them that gaining the crime lord’s trust might help them discover the truth behind his involvement in the Imperial plot. If you’re having trouble motivating the heroes to participate in the encounters, you might even go so far as to state that each encounter increases their chances of earning the crime lord’s favor (though you shouldn’t provide specific details).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Currying Darga's Favor</h2>\n<p>For the next <strong>few days</strong>, the heroes spend time in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, learning about the <strong>Hutt</strong> and his dealings by observing, participating in encounters, and snooping around. (Knowing that an agent of the Empire will be arriving should give them further incentive to stick around.) Though <strong>Darga </strong>seems eager to show them a good time, he remains wary of outsiders, so he plans to keep the heroes close. As such, they must not only uncover the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> involvement with the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> but also ingratiate themselves with <strong>Darga</strong> to gain his confidence.</p>\n<p>Five major <strong>events</strong> occur during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, each of which can affect how the crime lord feels about them. Each <strong>event</strong> is considered a noncombat encounter that gives the heroes a chance to showcase their ingenuity and skills (though combat may well break out at any time). Each <strong>event</strong> has a <strong>primary challenge</strong> and one or more <strong>secondary challenges.</strong> To win the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> favor, the heroes must succeed in the <strong>primary challenge</strong> of at least <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>five events.</strong> If they do so, the heroes gain <strong>XP</strong> as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 6</strong> challenge. Additionally, they gain <strong>Advantage </strong>when making<strong> skill checks</strong> against <strong>Darga</strong> or any member of his organization except <strong>Igren Demos</strong>. Finally, the <strong>Hutt</strong> has <strong>TC-663</strong> distribute <em>datacards</em> to the heroes that grant them access to a secret entrance to the guest quarters. These <em>datacards</em> might come in handy when they find the comatose Jedi hidden in the dungeon (see “<strong>Discovering Denia</strong>,” below).</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not succeed in the <strong>primary challenge</strong> of at least <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>five events,</strong> they still can learn what they need to know, but it will be more difficult.</p>\n<p>Treat each of the <strong>five events</strong> like an <strong>encounter.</strong> You won’t need to use <strong>Initiative</strong> unless <strong>combat</strong> breaks out, but once an event starts, treat the entire <strong>event</strong> like a single <strong>encounter</strong> for the purposes of per <strong>encounter resources,</strong> such as items or class features. If the heroes succeed in a specific <strong>event’s</strong> challenge, they gain <strong>XP</strong> as if they had defeated a <strong>CR</strong> <strong>6 </strong>challenge. If an event turns to combat (particularly <strong>Event 2: Gladiators</strong>), the heroes instead gain <strong>XP</strong> as normal for defeating enemies in battle. Keep in mind that engaging in combat during some of the events could cause the heroes to fail to overcome the associated <strong>challenges.</strong></p>\n<p>These <strong>events</strong> are designed to be spread out and run in nearly any order, allowing you to decide when to use them. As a general rule, the events should occur over at least <strong>two days</strong> (to allow <strong>Master Denia</strong> to make contact with the heroes during the night), and perhaps more depending on the flow of the game. Though most of the events can be run in any sequence, the event with the Imperial agents should be last, since it is likely the heroes’ main reason for staying in the <strong>palace</strong>. Additionally, several encounters from “<em><strong>Exploring Darga’s Palac</strong></em><strong>e</strong>” (page 13) work best when used to break up the action between the five events or when used during time spent away from <strong>Darga’s court</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Joining Darga</strong></p>\n<p>There is always a chance that one or more of the heroes truly will want to join Darga’s organization, and that’s fine—it might present a few complications, but it will also offer good story opportunities. As the adventure progresses, heroes who want to join the Hutt will probably be very eager to curry his favor, but they should also learn that Darga’s hold on his criminal empire is tenuous at best. By the end of <em>A Wretched Hive ,</em> when the Hutt flees to Cloud City on Bespin, the heroes should have an inkling that they could seize control of Darga’s organization for themselves. Indeed, that becomes a very real possibility when Darga meets his untimely demise in the next adventure, The Queen of Air and Darkness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Event 1: The Execution of Warrick Raden</h2>\n<p>By this time, it’s no secret that <strong>Darga</strong> is displeased with <strong>Warrick</strong> <strong>Raden </strong>for leading the heroes to him. True, the <strong>Hutt</strong> is interested in the heroes now that they’re here, but he doesn’t want <strong>Raden </strong>bringing just anyone to his secret <strong>palace</strong>, and he wants to make an example of the Devaronian. <strong>Darga </strong>has the errand boy dragged before his court and makes a declaration: <strong>Raden </strong>is to be executed, and since the heroes are new, they will perform the execution.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The Hutt wants to show his court that those who betray him to outsiders will be punished severely. Additionally, he sees an opportunity to test the heroes’ mettle by seeing if they truly are willing to do his dirty work. Two <strong>Gamorrean guards</strong> dump <strong>Raden </strong>unceremoniously in the open floor before the dais, and one of them holds out a <em>vibro-ax</em> for the heroes to use in the execution.</p>\n<p>The heroes’ <strong>primary challenge</strong> is to satisfy <strong>Darga’s </strong>need to punish <strong>Raden</strong> while proving their worthiness to be in his court. Of course, they can simply perform the execution—<strong>Raden </strong>is clearly a degenerate criminal, and the heroes might be tempted to remove such a person from the galaxy—which will satisfy <strong>Darga </strong>on all fronts. However, the killing would certainly be a <strong>Dark Side</strong> act, since <strong>Raden </strong>is helpless and at their mercy.</p>\n<p>If the heroes suggest an alternative fate for <strong>Raden</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> is willing to listen, particularly if their idea involves violence. If they propose setting <strong>Raden </strong>up in some kind of fight, <strong>Darga</strong> is very agreeable and will include the Devaronian as one of the combatants in a gladiator match (see below).</p>\n<p>If the heroes outright refuse to take part in <strong>Raden’s </strong>punishment without attempting to be diplomatic about it, they automatically fail to overcome the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> <strong>Darga</strong> sees them as weak and unwilling to do his bidding.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the heroes can make <strong>Darga</strong> think that they killed <strong>Raden</strong>, he will likely fall for it. Knocking <strong>Raden </strong>unconscious will help, though the heroes should take care that <strong>Darga</strong> doesn’t look too closely at the Devaronian’s <em><strong>“corpse”</strong></em> or he might figure out their ruse. The heroes can make a <strong>Charisma (Deception) check</strong> against <strong>Darga’s Wisdom (Insight)</strong>, and each character who contributes to the ruse can improve the group’s chance of success. If the heroes fail to convince <strong>Darga </strong>that they have killed <strong>Raden</strong>, he is disappointed but takes no actions against them, and he orders one of his <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> to do the job instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> This event presents an opportunity for the heroes to learn more about<strong> Igren Demos</strong>, <strong>Darga’s </strong>Neimoidian majordomo. <strong>Demos </strong>is far more than the simpering sycophant that he appears to be. Any hero who succeeds on a <strong>Wisdom (Insight) check </strong>against <strong>Igren Demos' Charisma (Deception)</strong> can tell that the Neimoidian watches them very closely during the event. For the most part, <strong>Demos </strong>is just studying the heroes, though he seems to linger his attentions longer on any characters who are <strong>Force </strong>sensitive—as if he senses a kindred spirit. Any hero who is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive can make a <strong>DC 13 Wisdom</strong> or <strong>Charisma check</strong> with proficiency if they are proficient in <strong>Insight</strong>, if they succeed they can determine that <strong>Demos </strong>is indeed <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, though if approached, he denies it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> The conversion isn't clear on what they mean by \"Force sensitive,\" and one might note that we bolded Force, and not sensitive so as not to indicate a specific game mechanic (such as the feat.) It's up to the GM to determine what it means to be Force sensitive in their game. Is it only Forceusers? Is it people with the feat? Is it a conversation a GM and player have at the beginning of every character's career, that might or might not pan out during the evolving story? We suggest <em>you</em> decide the meaning of \"Force sensitive,\" in the context of this event, as it best pertains to your game.</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Event 2: Gladiatory</h2>\n<p><strong>Darga</strong>, like all Hutts, has a short attention span and demands entertainment, usually of the more sadistic sort. The balcony overlooking the darkened area to the rear of <strong>Darga’s throne room is</strong> actually his viewing box for a moderately sized gladiator arena. From the looks of it, the arena was once a garden of some kind, likely filled with rare plants cultivated for a wealthy Neimoidian noble. The ceiling appears to be made entirely of transparisteel, though it has been crudely painted over, and gaudy lamps have been set in the walls all the way around the perimeter of the arena.</p>\n<p>At <strong>Darga’s</strong> command, the lights go up, and the heroes are invited to the viewing box for gladiator matches. <strong>Darga </strong>explains that he always enters a team of gladiators in an annual competition on <strong>Rattatak,</strong> and that over the <strong>course of the year</strong>, various teams challenge one another for the right to be <strong>Darga’s </strong>sponsored gladiators. After a few brutal matches during which several combatants are maimed or killed, <strong>Darga </strong>offers the heroes a chance to prove their own mettle in the combat arena.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> This is another chance for the heroes to curry <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor, this time by besting his current crop of champions. If the heroes express any concerns about participating, particularly if they feign concern for injuring <strong>Darga’s </strong>prized gladiators, the <strong>Hutt</strong> agrees to let the heroes fight with their weapons set on <strong>stun,</strong> promising that his gladiators will do the same. However, any match with weapons set on <strong>stun</strong> is destined to spiral out of control because the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> gladiators won’t take kindly to being defeated by newcomers and will switch their weapons back to lethal mode.</p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to defeat the opposing gladiators, they succeed in overcoming the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> If they choose not to take part in the match, they fail to impress <strong>Darga</strong>, who makes snide comments about their delicate sensibilities. However, if they present a reasonable alternative—such as offering to pay for half of the gladiator team’s <strong>sponsorship fee,</strong> or calling in favors on <strong>Rattatak</strong> to ensure an <strong>advantage</strong> for <strong>Darga’s </strong>team—they can still gain the Hutt’s favor.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> The heroes can earn a few <strong>credits</strong> by placing wagers on the gladiator matches that precede their own. <strong>Darga </strong>is more than happy to place bets with the heroes. Use the <strong>@JournalEntry[CjvJcbNvGLnJ5JCX]{Gambling} activity</strong> in <em><strong>Wretched Hives's</strong></em> <strong>Downtime</strong> section with the uptime verson's ruleset.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>goes on at length about how tough his gladiators are, and how he selects only the best for the games on Rattatak. He even mentions how his sponsorship earns the gladiators the finest weapons and armor that money can buy, again hoping to entice the heroes to enter the arena. If any of the heroes has displayed an aptitude for machinery or mentioned a penchant for technology, <strong>Darga </strong>makes a few circumspect inquiries as to the availability of that hero’s skills. Any character with proficiency in Armstech Tools who offers to upgrade a few weapons for <strong>Darga’s gladiators</strong> immediately earns the Hutt’s favor. Such a character may also grant themselves <strong>Advantage </strong>on a <strong>skill check </strong>made during interactions with <strong>Darga</strong>.</p>\n<p>Gladiator Match</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[Sm7SseN7GvTtyP7P]{2-03 Gladiator Match}</strong></p>\n<h2>Event 3: The Slavers</h2>\n<p><strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> has many contacts on many worlds, but few are as unsavory as a band of slavers known as the <strong>Iron Ring.</strong> These slavers are small-time—at least, compared to some of the more dangerous slaving rings in the galaxy—but what they lack in influence, they make up for in zeal. Most of the <strong>Iron Ring’s</strong> jurisdiction is on former Confederate worlds ravaged by the Clone Wars, where the Empire’s influence is minimal. <strong>Cato Neimoidia </strong>is one of their many planets of operation.</p>\n<p>A delegation from the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> comes to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> during the heroes’ stay there, and the <strong>slavers</strong> are not happy. The delegation consists of three tough-looking Humans, a Rodian with a large <em>blaster rifle,</em> a black-furred Wookiee, and a scarred Zabrak leading two Twi’lek <strong>slaves</strong> by their collars. They arrive seemingly unannounced, and as the <strong>audience chamber</strong> falls silent, it becomes apparent that <strong>Darga </strong>is less than pleased to see them. Taking up space in the middle of the chamber, the <strong>slavers</strong> offer everyone in the room, including the Hutt, a hard glare. After <strong>Darga </strong>spurts out a question in Huttese (“<em><strong>What are you doing here?</strong></em>”), the Zabrak steps forward and spits on the floor before speaking in heavily accented Basic. Read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“The slaves you have been selling us are worthless, Darga! They have been dying before we can even get them to market. They are used up—second-rate! I want my credits back for the last four shipments!”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Darga</strong> lets out a low, rumbling laugh that sounds sinister even for the gluttonous Hutt. He rolls his eyes toward the heroes, utters a side remark (“<em><strong>See what ungrateful business partners I have?</strong></em>”) and then gives the <strong>slavers</strong> an angry response, translated by his protocol droid. The crime lord tells them that they have had the same business agreement <strong>for years now</strong> and that he is not responsible if they don’t know how to take care of their own product. He says that if they do not apologize and leave, he will have no choice but to dispose of them. The <strong>Hutt</strong> seems unconcerned that they are all heavily armed because he believes that the <strong>slavers</strong> are just trying to talk tough and wouldn’t dare attempt to harm him.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> At this point, the <strong>slavers</strong> and the <strong>Hutt</strong> descend into a seemingly fruitless argument about <strong>slaves</strong> and payment, with neither side budging. In truth, <strong>Darga </strong>could appease the <strong>slavers</strong> easily, since he actually pays nothing for the <strong>slaves</strong> he passes on. However, he is stalling the delegation, waiting to see if the heroes will intervene on his behalf.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do nothing, <strong>Darga </strong>eventually turns a disappointed eye on them before granting the <strong>slavers</strong> their wish. Similarly, if the heroes intervene on the <strong>slavers’</strong> behalf, <strong>Darga </strong>grumbles about his guests not knowing when to keep their mouths shut, but again he acquiesces to the <strong>slavers’</strong> demands. In both of these cases, the <strong>Hutt</strong> grudgingly invites the <strong>slavers</strong> to remain for a time in his court.</p>\n<p>If the heroes intervene on the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> behalf, they can impress <strong>Darga </strong>by convincing the <strong>slavers</strong> not only to withdraw their request but also to continue buying <strong>slaves</strong> from the <strong>Hutt.</strong> The Zabrak leader begins the encounter <strong>unfriendly</strong> toward the heroes. Shifting his attitude to indifference through a<strong> DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) </strong>will earn the heroes a chance to convince him to keep his business with <strong>Darga</strong>. Unfortunately, the <strong>slavers</strong> are correct—<strong>Darga </strong>has been selling them <strong>slaves</strong> who have very little life left, and they have every right to be upset. Convincing them to continue buying from the <strong>Hutt</strong> is no easy task, and the heroes will need to present a solution that is beneficial for the <strong>slavers.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes present a reasonable solution to the negotiations, they gain <strong>Advantage</strong> on <strong>Charisma (Persuasion) checks</strong> to convince the <strong>slavers</strong> to keep their bargain with <strong>Darga</strong>. If the heroes succeed on a <strong>DC 20 Persuasion check</strong>, they convince the <strong>Zabrak</strong> to accept the deal, and they earn <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor for this challenge</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> During the discussion, the heroes might notice that one of the delegation’s Twi’lek <strong>slaves</strong> is more than she appears. As a servant enters the throne room with a large goblet of wine for the crime lord, the heroes can make a contested <strong>Wisdom (Perception) </strong>versus the Twi'lek's<strong> Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>, the Twi'lek slave has a <strong>+7</strong> to this roll <strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong><strong>(</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+7 # Sleight of Hand]])</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. If they succeed, </span>the heroes notice the Twi’lek  <strong>slave </strong>surreptitiously dropping a powdery substance into the goblet as she passes by. The substance, of course, is <strong>poison.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes stop <strong>Darga </strong>from drinking the <strong>poison,</strong> they immediately succeed on the <strong>primary challenge.</strong> Furthermore, if they reveal the Twi’lek’s guilt, <strong>Darga </strong>becomes enraged and threatens to throw the <strong>slavers</strong> in the dungeons. The Zabrak leader immediately withdraws his request for a new deal and apologizes profusely. Though he convinces <strong>Darga </strong>that the <strong>slave</strong> was acting of her own accord, the <strong>Hutt</strong> remains furious and declares the discussion over. The <strong>slavers</strong> beat a hasty retreat, except for the Wookiee, who secretly remains in the <strong>palace</strong> for a later encounter (see “<strong>@JournalEntry[YlpCNpJ2GNchsZn1]{2-05 A Knife in the Dark}</strong>\")</p>\n<p>If the heroes fail to notice the <strong>poison</strong> being slipped in <strong>Darga’s </strong>drink, the <strong>Hutt</strong> drinks it down and becomes ill. The <strong>poison</strong> isn’t strong enough to kill him, but it does sicken him—the slavers were hoping to gain an <strong>advantage</strong> in their negotiations. <strong>Darga </strong>declares an end to the day’s audience and retires to his personal chambers, though the heroes take no <strong>penalties</strong> and the event resumes the <strong>following day</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Event 4: Droid Racing</h2>\n<p>All work and no play makes <strong>Darga </strong>a dull Hutt—a motto the crime lord firmly stands by—and at a certain point, he calls for some diversion. One of <strong>Darga’s </strong>favorite activities is <strong>droid racing,</strong> wherein several members of his court compete for his favor while controlling droids in a race around the gladiator arena. <strong>Some years ago</strong>, a smuggling ship in <strong>Darga’s </strong>employ returned from the edges of the Unknown Regions with advanced droid interface technology. Instead of turning the technology over to scientists, <strong>Darga </strong>had his own technicians use it to create toys for his amusement. The result is a set of <strong>racing droids,</strong> each of which can be controlled remotely by donning a visor that allows the pilot to “see” out of the droid’s electronic eyes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the <strong>droid interfaces</strong> have some drawbacks. They are notoriously difficult to control and require intense focus and mental acuity to get any kind of result. Worse, in some cases, major damage to one of the racing droids has produced dangerous sensory feedback that has nearly <strong>scrambled the minds</strong> of the pilots. Despite this, <strong>Darga</strong> insists that members of his court take turns piloting the droids. He rewards the victor handsomely and makes no secret of his delight when a droid is wrecked and the pilot’s mind damaged.</p>\n<p>The races take place in <strong>Darga’s gladiator arena</strong>; barricades are set up to create a winding track that doubles back on itself to form a large, bending course. Within the course, artificial ramps and pits make it all the more likely that a racing droid will crash. As the course is being set up, <strong>Darga </strong>invites one of the heroes to pilot his personal racing droid. When pressed, <strong>Darga </strong>reveals that his last pilot<strong> has yet to recover</strong> from an injury he sustained during the race (“<em><strong>But you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Ho, ho, ho, ho!</strong></em>”). He promises a reward to the winner, and three more members of his court come forward to try their hand at a racing droid: one of the <strong>Quarren,</strong> a <strong>Gamorrean guard,</strong> and the Neimoidian majordomo <strong>Igren Demos</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> At this point, one of the heroes has a chance to pilot a <strong>racing droid.</strong> Each of the droids seems fragile, and <strong>Darga </strong>allows the hero who volunteers some time to get acquainted with the interface. During this time, the other members of the party might be able to provide assistance through <strong>Secondary Challenges.</strong> The droid is piloted through a simple system of visual commands, but managing those commands while keeping an eye on the track is challenging.</p>\n<p>The race consists of three laps around the track. For each lap, each pilot makes an <strong>Intelligence check</strong>. The highest result earns <strong>4 speed points</strong>, the second highest earns <strong>3 speed points</strong>, the next highest earns <strong>2 speed points</strong>, and the lowest earns a <strong>single speed point</strong>. Additionally, a roll of a <strong>natural 1 </strong>on the<strong> Intelligence check</strong> automatically comes in last place, causing the pilot to <strong>lose 1 speed point</strong>. At the end of the race (after <strong>three Intelligence checks</strong>), the pilot with the highest number of <strong>speed points </strong>wins the race.</p>\n<p>However, no underground race would be complete without a few dirty tricks. Once per lap, any pilot can make his droid <strong>attack </strong>another racing droid. To do this, the pilot declares that his droid tries to <strong>attack </strong>another droid and wagers <strong>1 </strong>to <strong>4 speed points</strong>. The pilot can wager more <strong>speed points</strong> than he currently owns, but failure has its consequences. The pilot then makes an<strong> attack roll</strong> for his droid (<strong>1d20 + the number of speed points wagered</strong>) against an <strong>AC</strong> of <strong>13</strong>. Success indicates that the target droid is <strong>damaged </strong>by the <strong>attack</strong>; the <strong>attacking </strong>pilot gains a number of <strong>speed points</strong> equal to the number wagered, while the defending pilot loses that same number of speed points. Failure indicates that the <strong>attacker </strong>loses the number of speed points wagered. Regardless of whether the <strong>attack </strong>succeeds or fails, the <strong>attacking </strong>pilot earns<strong> 1 less speed point</strong> on his next lap.</p>\n<p>Any racing droid that has fewer than <strong>0 speed points</strong> crashes and is destroyed. The control visor overloads, make the pilot roll a <strong>DC 15 constitution saving throw </strong>with a failed <strong>save </strong>giving <strong>1 level of @Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. If the <strong>“Hidden Enemies”</strong> or “<strong>Discovering Denia</strong>” encounters (see below) happen<strong> later the same day</strong>, the race might be a chance for the piloting hero to impose a level of exhaustion on the Quarren assassins or <strong>Igren Demos</strong>. That would give the heroes a small advantage when dealing with those opponents in the later encounter.</p>\n<p>The winner of the race receives a gaudy necklace valued at about <strong>500 credits.</strong> In truth, a hero who enters the race does not actually need to win to curry <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor; participation is enough to gain the Hutt’s approval. If the heroes refuse to participate, the race proceeds without them, and <strong>Igren Demos</strong> wins handily. <strong>Darga </strong>is not impressed with the heroes, remarking on their timidity, but it does not hurt their chances in other events.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge: </strong>Before the droid race starts, the heroes can study the technology that makes the race possible: the control visor. Any hero who makes a successful <strong>Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> can examine the visor and learn something about how it works. The information learned depends on the <strong>DC</strong> of the <strong>check</strong>, as shown below. Note that <strong>DCs</strong> higher than <strong>15 </strong>are considered expert knowledge, and thus only a character proficient in <strong>Intelligence (Technology) </strong>can obtain that information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DC 10: </strong>The droid control visor reads the eye movements of the user and translates them into commands, while simultaneously providing an in-droid view of the action. A successful <strong>Intelligence check </strong>is necessary to control the droid.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 15: </strong>The control visor is a bit unstable and could damage the user under some circumstances. During catastrophic failures, the wearer has to make a <strong>constitution saving throw</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>DC 20:</strong> The control visor’s software is full of errors, indicating that it is probably a prototype. A successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology)</strong> can smooth out some of the programming bugs, allowing the wearer to add their <strong>proficiency bonus </strong>to <strong>Intelligence checks</strong> to <strong>pilot</strong> the <strong>racing droids.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>DC 25:</strong> The problem with the control visor’s interface is that it was designed for a non-Human species. A successful <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check </strong>can alter the visor to better accommodate humanoid species, reducing the visor’s <strong>Constitution saving throw</strong> to <strong>DC 10</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge: </strong>The heroes can earn a few credits by placing wagers on the droid race. <strong>Darga </strong>is more than happy to place bets with the heroes. Use the<strong> @JournalEntry[CjvJcbNvGLnJ5JCX]{Gambling} activity</strong> in <em><strong>Wretched Hives's </strong></em><strong>Downtime </strong>section with the uptime verson's ruleset.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> Any character who examines the droid control visor can tell that the technology is fairly sophisticated and that its ability to translate the pilot’s commands is uncanny. During the race, allow this character to make a <strong>DC 13 Perception check </strong>to notice <strong>TC-663</strong>, the Hutt’s droid translator, during the race. Each time a <strong>droid</strong> slams into a wall or is smashed by another droid, <strong>TC-663</strong> seems to flinch a bit. If a hero approaches him and inquires about the flinching, he explains that the <strong>racing droids</strong> are not merely remotely controlled shells, but actual <strong>droids</strong> with intelligence and awareness, much like himself. <strong>TC-663</strong> thinks it is barbaric that the control visors are used to directly usurp the <strong>racing droids’</strong> self-aware functions. If the hero shows any sympathy, that character gains <strong>Advantage</strong> on all <strong>skill checks</strong> made on <strong>TC-663</strong> from this point forward. This benefit might come into play later, when <strong>TC-663</strong> approaches the heroes with a message from <strong>Switch.</strong></p>\n<h2>Final Event: Imperial Visitor</h2>\n<p>The final event of the heroes’ visit to the court is the arrival of an Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> who comes to discuss the resources being transferred through <strong>Darga’s </strong>slimy hands on behalf of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> This is probably the event that the heroes have been waiting for, since it is their best chance to learn more about the secret project.</p>\n<p>When this event begins, three people are ushered into <strong>Darga’s </strong>audience chamber: two men and one woman. Though none of them is wearing any kind of Imperial uniform, whispers of “<em><strong>Imperial agents</strong></em>” ripple through the court. The two men are dressed in basic laborer’s clothing, and their eyes scan the room as if they expect an attack at any moment. The woman is also simply dressed, but it is clear from her bearing that she considers herself well above this assignment.</p>\n<p>Allow any of the heroes present to make a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong>. Success indicates that they notice that each of the men carries an identical <em>blaster carbine,</em> and in fact the two men could be twins, other than a few small differences, such as the placement of scars. The two men are actually <strong>stormtroopers</strong> who have removed their armor; each is one of the few remaining clones of <strong>Jango Fett</strong> left over from the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> Before the Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> arrives, <strong>Darga </strong>summons the heroes close and quietly explains that he expects the Empire to try to double-cross him. Deals with the Empire have great potential rewards, he says, but one must always be careful when negotiating with such powerful allies. He implores the heroes to watch the proceedings and help him retain the upper hand in negotiations.</p>\n<p>If the heroes agree, the <strong>Hutt</strong> is very pleased, and he asks them to wait off to one side while he deals with the Imperial agent. When she arrives, flanked by her two guards, <strong>Darga</strong> rolls his eyes meaningfully in the heroes’ direction and then greets the newcomers (“Always a pleasure to serve the Empire! What can I do for you today?”). Neither the agent nor her guards seem to notice the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> glance toward the heroes.</p>\n<p>The Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> wastes no time and launches into a spiel about the transfer of Tibanna gas from <strong>Darga’s </strong>holdings to the Empire. She insists that while <strong>Darga’s </strong>supplies have been sufficient thus far, the Empire needs him to step up his production of refined <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> immediately. As the heroes should come to understand, <strong>Darga </strong>has been shipping the gas (which is used in producing <em>blaster</em> and <em>turbolaser</em> bolts) to the Empire in substantial quantities, and now they want more . The <strong>liaison</strong> offers the <strong>Hutt</strong> an <strong>80% increase</strong> in payments for a <strong>100% increase</strong> in output, claiming that it is more than fair since he will be making more money overall.</p>\n<p>Additionally, she makes two other propositions. First, the Empire is willing to offer a further <strong>20% increase</strong> in payments if the <strong>Hutt</strong> accepts the increase in <strong><em>“biological”</em></strong> resources. Though she really means <strong>slaves,</strong> she does not come out and say so, and the heroes might not connect this statement with the complaints of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> slavers. (It’s fine if they don’t; the full extent of the sordid deal will be exposed in the next adventure, <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>.)</p>\n<p>Second, the <strong>liaison</strong> offers to provide <strong>Darga</strong> with a personal Imperial security retinue as a sign of their continued good faith. The <strong>Hutt</strong> would have an Imperial regiment stationed in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and a flight of Imperial starfighters would escort him when traveling off-world.</p>\n<p>At this point, <strong>Darga </strong>turns to the heroes for advice. If the heroes have not set up a private method of communicating with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>dismisses the Imperials temporarily so they won’t overhear the discussion. If the heroes provide him with the advice he wants to hear, they can earn his favor. Of the three proposals, <strong>Darga </strong>believes that the first one is sound (more money coming in at only a slight discount) and the latter two are not. The <strong>slaves</strong> he has been getting from the Empire are used up, and payments in credits are more reliable in the long run. Additionally, the promised security retinue seems like little more than a plot to expand Imperial influence on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> and keep the <strong>Hutt</strong> under the Imperial Security Bureau’s watchful eye.</p>\n<p>If the heroes make the correct recommendation <em><strong>(“yes”</strong></em> on the increased production, <em><strong>“no”</strong></em> on the increased payment in biological resources, and <em><strong>“no”</strong></em> on the Imperial retinue) for two out of the three options, <strong>Darga </strong>is suitably impressed by their keen minds, and they will have gained more favor with the crime lord.</p>\n<p><strong>Secondary Challenge:</strong> As the encounter with the Imperial <strong>liaison</strong> goes on, grant a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> to any heroes who were in the company of <strong>Bail Organa</strong> before the trip to <strong>Felucia </strong>in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>. Success indicates that the heroes recognize the <strong>liaison</strong> as someone they spotted in the halls of <strong>Organa’s palace</strong> on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. (Alternatively, if the heroes did not play <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they might recognize the <strong>liaison</strong> as one of the crewmembers of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>.)</p>\n<p>In truth, the <strong>liaison</strong> is a double agent who secretly works for the Imperial Security Bureau. Her real name is <strong>Victra Sinde,</strong> though the name she uses when posing as a member of <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> security force is <strong>Alysa.</strong> She has been spying on <strong>Organa</strong> for several months now, though she has been unable to uncover hard evidence of his involvement in treasonous activities. She was called away from her assignment to assist the Empire in continuing their arrangement with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, and she was not expecting to run into anyone who might recognize her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes confront <strong>Sinde,</strong> she denies any involvement with <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. If the heroes continue to make accusations, she threatens them with immediate arrest. Mentally, she notes the faces (and names, if possible) of the heroes and vows to ensure that the Empire becomes aware of their activities. If the heroes allow <strong>Sinde</strong> to leave after such an exchange, she might become a thorn in their side down the road, particularly if they journey to worlds under tight Imperial control, such as <strong>Coruscant</strong> or <strong>Nizon.</strong> Though such repercussions are beyond the scope of this adventure, feel free to have <strong>Sinde</strong> show up later.</p>\n<p>Informing <strong>Bail Organa</strong> that he has a double agent in his midst certainly causes an uproar on <strong>Alderaan</strong>. If this occurs, <strong>Sinde</strong> does not return to <strong>Organa’s </strong>service, having learned ahead of time that her cover has been blown, and <strong>Organa </strong>is grateful for the heroes’ efforts.</p>\n<h3>Counseling Darga</h3>\n<p>The heroes might be unsure of how to provide <strong>Darga </strong>with counsel during the encounter with the Imperial <strong>liaison,</strong> and they might look to their skills as a means of determining the correct course of action. Though you should be careful not to give away the right answers with simple <strong>skill checks</strong>, you can steer the heroes in the right direction. For example, a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> can reveal that the Empire has made offers of security retinues to nobles and powerful administrators in the past, most of the time on worlds where Imperial forces were particularly thin. A successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> can tell the heroes that biological resources of any kind are notoriously unstable, and rarity is one of the only things that can drive their value up. Lastly, a successful<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check </strong>can tell the heroes that Imperial contracts are almost always spread very thin, and that the Empire rarely offers substantial contract increases to individuals.</p>\n<h2>Exploring Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>Since the events above are likely to take place over the <strong>course of several days</strong>, adventurous heroes might want to explore <strong>Darga’s palace </strong>between sessions in the court. Similarly, you might wish to encourage them to poke around so that they can learn valuable pieces of information. At the end of the<strong> first day </strong>in the <strong>palace</strong>, the Hutt gives each hero his or her own room in the guest quarters, which were actually the servants’ quarters when the building was owned by Neimoidian nobles. The rooms are surprisingly clean, though sparsely appointed, and Gamorrean guards casually patrol the halls during the evenings. The heroes have a few amenities at their disposal—servants bring food or drink to their quarters—and if they have done something to impress the Hutt during the day, he might send them evening gifts, such as fine foods, spice, or even entertainment (in various forms).</p>\n<p>Below are several encounters that can take place in any order during the time between events in <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>throne room.</strong></p>\n<h3>The Aviary</h3>\n<p>When the heroes arrived on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, they tangled with <strong>Kessra,</strong> the leader of the <strong>Vipers</strong> swoop gang. If they defeated her but left her alive, she follows the heroes to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> to exact her revenge upon them. During their audience with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> she hid and observed them from a distance, and at some point she decides to whittle them down a few at a time. Late one night, one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>servants (a <strong>Neimoidian </strong>who seems afraid of everything) visits the rooms of one or two heroes who are particularly charismatic or who had some kind of special interaction with <strong>Kessra</strong> during the swoop gang encounter. The servant tells the heroes that <strong>Darga </strong>has summoned them to a secret meeting in his <strong>aviary</strong> because he cannot trust anyone else with what he has to say. As far as the <strong>Neimoidian </strong>knows, this is correct. The message was relayed to him by <strong>Kessra,</strong> dressed as one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>dancing girls, who claimed to be passing the information on from the Hutt.</p>\n<p>The<strong> Neimoidian servant</strong> leads the heroes out of the guest quarters and to an upper level of the <strong>palace</strong>. Once there, he points to a set of sliding double doors and says that <strong>Darga </strong>waits inside. When the heroes pass through the doors, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The interior of the aviary is quiet, and rising up from either side of a winding path are numerous trees, each with many colorful birds sleeping while perched on their branches. The aviary is dark, and a number of small orange lamps illuminate the trail. High above, one of Cato Neimoidia’s moons shines down through the canopy of trees, casting a faint silvery hue over everything within.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Hiding in the shadows deep inside the aviary, <strong>Kessra</strong> activates a remote trigger that shuts and locks the sliding double doors. Once the exit is sealed, <strong>Kessra</strong> has four Neimoidian <strong>kreehawks </strong>attack the heroes.</p>\n<h3>Aviary Attack</h3>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[Bb1vBLJrCKGSRkON]{2-04 Aviary Attack}</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/creatures_monsters/neimoidian%20kreehawk/neimoidian_kreehawk_art.webp\" width=\"620\" height=\"749\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[JYgmmdZn0jDDqdV4]{05 - Handout 5 - Neimoidian Kreehawk}</p>\n<h2>The Moneychanger</h2>\n<p>Poking around the lower levels of <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>palace </strong>eventually brings the heroes into contact  with <strong>Darga’s </strong>moneychanger, an elderly Duros named <strong>Gome.</strong> He handles all of <strong>Darga’s</strong> finances and ensures that no trails lead to the <strong>Hutt. Gome</strong> has been working for the crime lord for decades now, ever since <strong>Darga</strong> first rose to power, and he is exceptionally good at his job. Unlike others who have benefited from <strong>Darga’s </strong>wealth, <strong>Gome</strong> is mostly indifferent about his work. He seems to have no emotional investment in <strong>Darga’s </strong>crime syndicate and is puzzled by the idea that someone might try to meddle in the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> resides in a small apartment just off of the guest quarters, which serves as both his home and his workspace. The Duros has little daily contact with anyone other than the servants who bring him food and drink, so when the heroes show up at his door, he is more than a bit surprised. (The heroes might be drawn to his apartment by the <strong>loud Neimoidian opera </strong>echoing from behind the door, or because they saw a <strong>Gamorrean guard</strong> from <strong>Darga’s court </strong>bring a transparent bag full of <em>credit sticks</em> to <strong>Gome’s</strong> room.)</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: Gome</strong> presents a good opportunity for the heroes to learn more about <strong>Darga’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> particularly the nature of what he trades to the Empire. Though <strong>Gome</strong> is surprised to see the heroes, his attitude begins as <strong>indifferent</strong> toward them. If the heroes shift his attitude to friendly through a <strong>DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he is happy to discuss all manner of secrets with them—at least, the ones he knows about. <strong>Gome</strong> is older and probably nearing the end of his days, so he tends to ramble and get distracted. The heroes will need to keep him on track if they are to learn anything from him, so you should portray him as absent-minded to encourage the heroes to steer him back to their conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>Gome</strong> knows the following: At the conclusion of the Clone Wars, <strong>Darga</strong> took over a Tibanna gas smuggling ring after its leader was slain by Separatist mercenaries. Since that time, he has managed to increase the amount of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> that is being smuggled away from its normal channels, and the smuggling ring has proven to be his most profitable venture, even ahead of his slave trading. The Empire approached <strong>Darga</strong> a few months ago with an interest in obtaining some of his <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> supplies off the record—though <strong>Gome</strong> recalls that they threatened to bring down the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> crime syndicate if he didn’t play nicely. Since then, <strong>Darga </strong>has been funneling every canister of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> to the Empire for a secret project. The gas, which is refined on the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> is loaded into large starships and handed over to the Empire in the space above that world. In return, <strong>Darga </strong>receives some kind of goods <strong>(Gome</strong> does not know what), and their transaction is ended. The exchange takes place quickly and seems private because few people even know that Bespin exists; it’s too small to have an Imperial presence. <strong>Darga</strong> has made a handsome profit from the arrangement, and he maintains a remote headquarters in Cloud City, where he can personally oversee the transactions and enjoy the amenities of the floating city.</p>\n<h2>Hidden Enemies</h2>\n<p>Being guests of <strong>Darga the Hutt </strong>confers a small amount of protection on the heroes, but some would still rather see them eliminated than left alive to meddle further. During one of the nights that the heroes sleep in the guest quarters, a cadre of assassins tries to kill them.</p>\n<p>If any of the heroes previously revealed themselves to be <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive while in <strong>Darga’s court</strong>, the assassins are sent by<strong> Igren Demos</strong>. In this scenario, the majordomo fears that the heroes might expose his own <strong>Force </strong>sensitivity and wants to curtail any potential threat to his ascension to power. Sending a message through a lackey, he tricks <strong>Darga’s </strong>Quarren assassins into thinking the order to kill the heroes came from the Hutt. He also enlists the help of two members of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> slaver delegation—the Wookiee and the Twi’lek poisoner.</p>\n<p>If no hero revealed himself to be <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive, the assassins are sent by the <strong>slavers.</strong> In this scenario, the <strong>slavers</strong> want the heroes dead as punishment for interfering with their negotiations with <strong>Darga</strong>. The same group <strong>attacks </strong>the heroes—three <strong>Quarren,</strong> the <strong>Wookiee,</strong> and the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> poisoner. However, if the heroes discovered the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> attempting to poison <strong>Darga</strong>, she does not take part in this <strong>attack</strong>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Knife in the Dark</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[YlpCNpJ2GNchsZn1]{2-05 A Knife in the Dark}</strong></p>\n<h2>A Visit from Six-Six</h2>\n<p>One member of <strong>Darga’s court</strong> that the heroes have interacted with but might not have thought much about is the translating protocol droid, <strong>TC-663</strong>. Unremarkable during the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> thus far, <strong>TC-663</strong> is occasionally seen wandering the halls of the <strong>palace </strong>on one errand or another. At some point when the heroes are all together away from the Hutt’s court, the shiny silver droid approaches them and asks to speak with them in private.</p>\n<p>When he is certain they are alone,<strong> TC-663</strong> (who insists that the heroes call him <strong>Six-Six</strong>) explains that in addition to serving as the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> translator, he also serves another master—a droid crime lord named <strong>Switch,</strong> who lives on <strong>Sel Zonn Station</strong> above the world of <strong>Brentaal.</strong> If the heroes played through <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, they have probably already encountered <strong>Switch</strong> and perhaps even offered to act as his agents in the field.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six</strong> reveals that he has come to convey a small piece of information on <strong>Switch’s</strong> behalf. The droid tells the heroes that he has been monitoring communications leaving <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, and it seems that someone has been transmitting information to the Empire while the <strong>Hutt</strong> sleeps, receiving instructions in return.</p>\n<p><strong>Six-Six </strong>has been sending these messages on to <strong>Switch,</strong> but the droid crime lord has been unable to break their encryption. <strong>Switch</strong> has ordered<strong> Six-Six</strong> to turn the encrypted transmissions file over to the heroes and see what they can make of it. If the heroes are willing to share their findings with <strong>Six-Six</strong> (who will share them with <strong>Switch),</strong> they can have the file at no charge.</p>\n<p>Any hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> decrypts the file and retrieves the contents of the message. It reveals that late at night, the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> majordomo, <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, has been contacting an Imperial communications relay somewhere in the sector. The heroes cannot be certain who he is communicating with, but they know that <strong>Demos</strong> has been transmitting information about <strong>Darga’s </strong>dealings—particularly his slave trading—on a regular basis. The most recent communication specifically mentions that the slavers that <strong>Darga </strong>has been dealing with are unhappy with their merchandise. Additionally, several messages mention “<strong>the prisoner</strong>” but provide no further details.</p>\n<p>If confronted about his communications with the Empire, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> staunchly denies it. Presenting the decrypted file does not help because <strong>Demos </strong>claims that it must be a forgery, and <strong>Darga </strong>is inclined to agree with his trusted advisor. If the heroes remain adamant that the majordomo is doing something untoward even after <strong>Darga </strong>dismissed this claim, the <strong>Hutt</strong> might become upset. To represent his shifting attitudes, you might wish to treat a previous incident in which the heroes successfully curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor as a failure instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/sixsix/sixsix_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"573\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[YcEBkSk41K8jcfDK]{07 - Handout 7 - Six-Six}</p>\n<h2>Discovering Denia</h2>\n<p>One of the most critical events that happens during the heroes’ stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> is their discovery of a comatose Jedi Master named <strong>Denia</strong>. This event should occur only near the end of their stay in the <strong>palace</strong>, and most likely after the heroes have gone through the five events in <strong>Darga’s court </strong>(and perhaps obtained the <em>datacard</em> granting access to the guest quarters). Since the discovery of <strong>Denia </strong>will probably conclude the heroes’ time in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, do not rush in introducing this event.</p>\n<p>During the Clone Wars, <strong>Denia </strong>was fighting on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong> when she was injured in an explosion. One of the Separatist generals had her unconscious form brought to this <strong>palace </strong>and placed in an artificial coma while they decided what to do with her. When the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end, the Separatists fled the <strong>palace </strong>and left the Jedi behind. <strong>Darga</strong> moved in soon after and discovered <strong>Denia’s </strong>comatose body. Never one to throw away a potential resource, <strong>Darga</strong> had her moved to the lowest levels of the <strong>palace </strong>and kept unconscious, thinking that there might come a day when she could prove useful. When the heroes arrived, <strong>Denia </strong>could sense their presence even while unconscious (either because one or more of the heroes is <strong>Force </strong>sensitive, or because destiny swirls about them), and she reaches out to them for help.</p>\n<p>This first becomes apparent when the heroes (particularly any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes) start hearing whispers in their heads. If the heroes stay in <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> after their time in his court, one or two of them begin to hear whispers in their sleep, so strongly that they awaken. If the heroes appear to be making plans to leave, you can have them hear the whispers while awake. The voice, clearly that of a woman, says things such as, <em><strong>“Help</strong> <strong>me,”</strong></em> and “<em><strong>I know you can hear me.”</strong></em> If the heroes attempt to ignore the whispers, the voice becomes more insistent, begging for help and pleading with them to find her.</p>\n<p>If the heroes search for a way to find the whispers, they discover that the voice becomes stronger if they descend through the guest quarters into the lower reaches of the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes curried <strong>Darga’s </strong>favor and were given the <em>datacard</em> to access the secret way in and out of the guest quarters, they can also use it to access a turbolift to the lower levels of the guest quarters. The turbolift leads them directly to the chambers where <strong>Denia </strong>is being held.</p>\n<p>If the heroes never obtained the <em>datacard,</em> they can still reach <strong>Denia </strong>by finding a stairwell that leads down into the lower guest quarters. However, this path passes through an antechamber where some of <strong>Darga’s Gamorrean guards</strong> await. The guards tell the heroes to turn back, and if they refuse, a fight ensues.</p>\n<h2>Into the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[PyhIV17Hc6Zo8A34]{2-06 Into the Dungeons}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>is being held in a dank, disgusting area directly beneath the guest quarters that resembles a dungeon. The chamber is in disrepair, and structural damage to the <strong>palace </strong>has allowed rainwater to leak in, giving the place a musty feel. If the heroes step out of the turbolift, they see a narrow hallway filled with pools of stagnant water, with cells off to the right. The whispers grow louder in their minds, urging them on and giving them directions to a large metal door.</p>\n<p>Pushing a button on the door causes it to creak and stutter as it slides open, revealing a chamber that resembles a dilapidated hospital room. It has the same musty smell as the outer hallway, but in this room is a large bed on which lays a woman well into her older years, connected to a variety of machines that seem to be monitoring her vital functions. A large tube of semitransparent liquid is connected to the woman intravenously, and her chest rises and falls slowly. Once inside the room, the whispers in the <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes’ minds become stronger, and the voice claims that she can feel them close to her. <strong>Denia </strong>telepathically begs the heroes to free her, though the limitations on her telepathy keep her from asking or answering any more questions</p>\n<p>Any hero can disconnect <strong>Denia </strong>from the machines that are keeping her in a coma. A hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine) check</strong> can bring her out of the coma gently, and she regains consciousness with <strong>4 levels of exhaustion</strong>. Otherwise, she regains consciousness with 5 levels of exhaustion and cannot move. This exhaustion cannot be removed until she receives extended medical treatment for at least a week (which she will be able to get aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> between adventures).</p>\n<p>When <strong>Denia </strong>has been brought out of her coma, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The eyes of the older woman on the bed flicker open and then seem glazed for a long moment before drawing into sharp focus. She lifts her head slightly to look you over before raising herself to a sitting position.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Thank you. I’ve spent too long trapped inside my own body. Tell me, how fares the war? What planet is this? Has the Jedi Council sent you to find me?”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/jedi%20master%20denia/jedi_master_denia_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"628\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[mj4aYSopRY2Z6W3x]{08 - Handout 8 - Master Denia}</p>\n<p>Clearly, the woman has no idea that the Clone Wars are over, nor how much time has passed since she was placed in her coma. She tells the heroes that she is a Jedi Master and that she was assigned to <strong>Plo Koon’s</strong> battle group here on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. She was engaged in a pitched battle against the Separatists when a droid starfighter crashed near her, sending her into blackness. When her mind had recovered from the damage done to her body, she found herself unable to awaken or to purge her system of the drugs that were keeping her in a coma. She has been trying to reach out for help, but the only visitor to her room has been someone who seems shrouded in darkness. She doesn’t know who this person is (in truth, it is <strong>Igren Demos</strong>, the majordomo) or why he or she enters the room, but she did not attempt to make contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Denia </strong>asks the heroes to help her escape, since she has clearly been held prisoner for a while. She has many questions for them and wants to learn what has happened since she was knocked unconscious. If the heroes tell her honestly what has transpired since the conclusion of the Clone Wars, she senses the truth of their words and seems disheartened, but she vows to press on and escape from the <strong>palace</strong>. If the heroes attempt to deceive her, <strong>Denia </strong>tries to sense their true motives (her Perception score is high, even when penalized, and she has a good chance to see through their ruses), but she plays along for the time being. She is eager to leave and has no desire to stay in these dungeons any longer than necessary.</p>\n<p>The heroes probably have some questions for <strong>Denia</strong>. Below are some answers to common questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Do you know anything about Darga the Hutt or the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>No, I’ve been trapped here inside my own head for too long. I’m afraid those names mean absolutely nothing to me.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>You were a Jedi; how did you escape Order 66? </strong>“<em>It wouldn’t surprise me if I was thought to have been killed in battle. It’s likely that this... Empire doesn’t even know that I exist.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can you help us get you out of here? </strong>“<em>I will do what I can. However, I can already feel panic rising above us. I’d say that by now, they know you’ve set me free.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can you tell us anything more about the dark presence you sensed?</strong> “<em>Only that whoever it was seemed to be afraid of me as well. I don’t know who it was, but I sense that he or she is still nearby.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@Actor[yCKIn7SvDxjfWhN8]{Jedi Master Denia}</strong></p>\n<h2>Through the Dungeons</h2>\n<p>As soon as <strong>Denia </strong>was freed from her comatose state, <strong>Igren Demos</strong> sensed it and awoke his Hutt master. <strong>Darga</strong>, unprepared for having a full-fledged Jedi Master on the loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, ordered <strong>Demos </strong>to ready his personal starship for immediate departure and headed to the planet <strong>Bespin</strong> within <strong>minutes</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>remained behind, charged with eliminating the heroes and<strong> Master Denia </strong>as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Igren Demos</strong> is no fool, and though he tries to stop the heroes, he doubts that he can do it alone (see below for more on his plans). Many of the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> guards are mobilized, and a contingent of warriors moves toward the dungeon area to make sure the heroes do not escape with <strong>Denia</strong>. <strong>Demos </strong>locks down the doors in the lower guest quarters area and the dungeon area, shutting off power to the turbolift and sealing the blast doors over the stairwell exit up to the guard room. Using a secret passage from <strong>Darga’s throne room</strong> directly to the dungeon level, the guards open the secret door in the hallway outside <strong>Denia’s </strong>chamber just as the heroes emerge.</p>\n<h2>Out of Captivity</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[ifuf0JXwiJJmWe3G]{2-07 Out of Captivity}</strong></p>\n<h2>The Majordomo</h2>\n<p>As soon as<strong> Igren Demos</strong> learned that the <strong>Hutt</strong> was abandoning his <strong>palace </strong>and that the Jedi Master had been freed, he began putting a plan into motion to prevent the prisoner from escaping. <strong>Demos </strong>has secretly been in contact with <strong>Imperial Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong>, a former Jedi who pledged himself to the service of the Empire after witnessing the horrors of the Clone Wars. <strong>Demos </strong>has hidden his <strong>Force-</strong>sensitivity from the Inquisitor thus far, and he hopes that his alliance with the Empire will help him supplant <strong>Darga </strong>and seize control of the organization for his own. When the <strong>Hutt</strong> flees aboard his personal yacht to <strong>Bespin,</strong> <strong>Igren Demos</strong> dispatches the <strong>Gamorreans</strong> to delay the heroes and <strong>Denia</strong> while the majordomo makes contact with <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> via the Holonet. <strong>Demos</strong> implores the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> to come to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> quickly because he has cornered a surviving Jedi Master. <strong>Demos </strong>hopes to turn <strong>Denia</strong> over to the Inquisitorius in exchange for their assistance in making sure that <strong>Darga </strong>never returns to<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for <strong>Demos</strong>, he did not plan on the heroes’ resourcefulness. When they make their way up through the secret passage (as all other avenues are currently blocked), they arrive in the <strong>throne room</strong> just as <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> finishes telling <strong>Demos </strong>that he is on his way.

These informants don’t have the same kind of training that other Imperial agents do. In fact, they are little more than eager civilians who have been given a blaster and some basic combat training.

She tries to find cover and hide, hoping that the heroes will take care of the <strong>Imperial agents</strong> that are after her. She will assist when possible, but her persistent condition makes her good for little besides encouragement and motivation. <strong>Maya</strong> <strong>fights defensively</strong> on every <strong>round</strong>, taking no <strong>attacks</strong>, and always tries to hide behind something to gain <strong>cover</strong> from attackers.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter ends, the heroes should realize that reinforcements are likely on the way.

The heroes may be anywhere in the area but preferably are near the club door when this encounter starts. The first thing they may see is a nearby surveillance droid attempting to observe the action without them noticing.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When ready to begin, have the heroes make<strong> Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> versus the surveillance droid’s <strong>Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>. If they see it, read its read-aloud text first, then read the following <strong>2 rounds</strong> later. If they don’t see the droid, wait about <strong>2 rounds</strong> and go ahead with the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As you begin to make your way through the alley away from the Outlander, you suddenly hear the unmistakable sound of armored troopers. They appear almost immediately, several stormtroopers led by a uniformed ISB agent.

The skirmish should go quickly, since the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> are outmatched. During the fight, allow the heroes to make occasional <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> to notice the droid, if needed. When <strong>4 Stormtroopers</strong> have died, an <strong>LAAT/le</strong> drops from above, filled with <strong>five</strong> more <strong>stormtroopers</strong> and another <strong>agent.</strong> It drops off the <strong>troopers</strong> and agent, then attempts to cut off fleeing heroes.</p>\n<h4>FSD-6D Flying Surveillance Droid</h4>\n<p>The <strong>FSD-6D</strong> is a common Imperial surveillance droid, used wherever general surveillance is required for law enforcement and lesser military operations. It is fast, observant, and well-programmed in surveillance and stealth techniques. Most of its sensors are mounted on its spherical body, but one sensor pack is mounted on a <strong>3-foot</strong> extendable stalk that allows the <strong>droid</strong> to look around corners. However, the <strong>droid</strong> is so common that the camera is easily recognized if noticed.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>In the distance, you see a small, dark gray spherical droid hovering, partially hidden by the corner of a nearby building.

If detected, it tries to conceal itself, but it forgoes hiding for keeping line of sight with the eye stalk sensor it has, granted it only <strong>three quarters cover</strong>. Its duty is observation before self-preservation. If attacked, it defends itself with its blaster. If the heroes flee, it follows. If they lose it, it remains in the area, searching the most probable path.</p>\n<h4>ISB Special Agent</h4>\n<p><strong>ISB Special Agents</strong> often provide direct backup for agents in the field. As such, they occasionally command <strong>stormtroopers</strong> or Imperial forces ordered to give them aid in pursuing suspects. However, they are better suited to taking on their opponents directly through stealth and <strong>ranged attacks</strong>.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The uniformed ISB Agent wears a white Imperial uniform.

Once the patrol transport has dropped off its troops, it closes its doors and attempts to cut off escaping heroes.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Most of the encounter should occur in the alley, but it might carry over into nearby streets if the heroes make a run for it. If the heroes surrender or are captured, they are arrested and hauled off to detention in the speeder. If the heroes flee on foot, the Imperials follow. If the heroes flee in a speeder, the <strong>LAAT/le</strong> and <strong>surveillance droid</strong> give chase, soon joined by others (see @JournalEntry[KueKFc7Hj1kh217Q]{6-06 Imperial Pursuit, Part 2}Imperial Pursuit, Part 2).

Instead of exhibiting hope at the sight of potential rescuers, he quickly looks away, as if to say, “Leave me alone.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This room also contains a thick plasteel table, with traces of a black substance on it and a Jedi robe sprawled across it. <strong>Master Thorla</strong> is in very bad shape, both physically and mentally. His body is emaciated, and he sports several burns and cuts. To run this dramatic encounter, you must understand the <strong>Jedi’s</strong> backstory (see the sidebar below). The heroes might suspect that the prisoner is a <strong>Jedi</strong> and decide to free him. If they interrogate him, <strong>Thorla</strong> tells them to leave him alone and that he is beyond redemption.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Universal Energy Cage</strong> was designed specifically to contain a <strong>Force-user’s powers</strong>. Prisoners in the cage can, however, use the <strong>Force</strong> at very low levels, such as casting <strong>cantrips.</strong> The cage’s functions are controlled by a handheld remote that is currently in <strong>Draco’s</strong> possession. The cage has no visible controls, and the only way to open it is to destroy it, which endangers the life of the prisoner within. The <strong>Universal Energy Cage</strong> has a <strong>damage threshold</strong> of <strong>10</strong> and <strong>55 (5d10) hit points</strong>. The cage is also built with a contact shock field, and every time the cage receives <strong>damage</strong> from an <strong>attack</strong> that deals <strong>25 damage</strong> or more, the Jedi inside receives a <strong>nonlethal shock</strong> that deals <strong>9 ([[/r 2d8[lightning] # Lightning damage]])  damage</strong>, this effect also occurs when an <strong>attack</strong> would automatically miss. When this happens, <strong>Thorla</strong> yelps in pain, but does not otherwise react.</p>\n<p>Once the <strong>Jedi</strong> is free, whether he is conscious or not, the heroes notice that his skin is charred in multiple places, showing that he has suffered many shocks. He has <strong>four levels of @Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>, which can only be removed by receiving extensive, long-term medical and psychological care. If <strong>Thorla</strong> is conscious, he does not run away or try to escape, but he won’t answer the heroes’ questions, either, wanting only to be left alone. He’s been fighting off <strong>Draco’s</strong> attempts at turning him to the <strong>dark side</strong> and has fallen into despair. Since the loss of his <strong>Padawan, Thorla</strong> has become disconsolate, and any mention of Jedi or Imperials angers him. He has an unfriendly attitude and if the heroes physically push or restrain him, he becomes violent and <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<p>This encounter is a chance for heroes with investment in <strong>Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> to be very useful. With some good roleplaying and a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, Thorla might be coaxed into revealing that he was a <strong>Jedi,</strong> but that he no longer has the will to go on. If the player beats a <strong>DC 19 Charisma (Persuasion)</strong> instead, <strong>Thorla</strong> will become <strong>friendly</strong> and additionally answer questions about his captors. An alternative way to convince <strong>Thorla</strong> to talk is to show <strong>Thorla</strong> his <strong>Padawan’s</strong> broken <em>lightsaber</em> (if the heroes obtained it from the Squibs).</p>\n<p><strong>Thorla</strong> can provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He knows <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> and <strong>Raik Muun,</strong> and he suspects that they are inside the archives room in the southwest corner of the <strong>sublevel.</strong></li>\n<li>If asked about a <strong>holocron,</strong> he reveals that indeed the Inquisitor has one in his possession.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Thorla</strong> refuses to accompany the heroes willingly. He says that all the <strong>Jedi</strong> are dead and there is no reason to go on—not with sadistic torturers like <strong>Draco</strong> running the galaxy. If told of <strong>Master Denia</strong>, the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> says he’s never heard of her, and besides, one more <strong>Jedi</strong> won’t make any difference.</p>\n<p>In any case, when the heroes realize that the broken <strong>Jedi</strong> will not budge, they should move on.

After <strong>two months</strong>, the ruthless organization was dismantled, but at the cost of <strong>Kritz’s</strong> life. <strong>Thorla</strong> blamed himself for his student’s death and exiled himself to his homeworld of <strong>Ryloth.</strong> He sought solitude in the planet's badlands but soon found a new purpose.</p>\n<p>A<strong> few months</strong> into the Clone Wars, <strong>Master Devan</strong> sent envoys to <strong>Ryloth</strong> to invite her old friend to join her at the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> as the new <strong>Master of Lightsabers.</strong> When the envoys finally found <strong>Thorla,</strong> they discovered that he had spent the <strong>last year</strong> rescuing Twi'lek prisoners from slavers and had formed a community called the <strong>Enclave. Thorla</strong> had also taken on a new <strong>Padawan,</strong> a young Lethan Twi’lek named <strong>Dorv'Tilsta.</strong> Witnessing all the good that <strong>Master Thorla</strong> was accomplishing, the envoys respected his decision to decline <strong>Master Devan’s</strong> offer.</p>\n<p>Increasing slaver <strong>attacks</strong> forced Thorla to delay a visit to the <strong>Almas Academy.</strong> Then <strong>Order 66</strong> came. <strong>Thorla</strong> felt the death of his fellow Jedi through the <strong>Force</strong> and moved the <strong>Enclave</strong> to a more secure location, but after <strong>two long years,</strong> he risked exposure to learn more about the current state of the galaxy. Repulsed by what he discovered, he decided to investigate the fate of his old friend <strong>Devan</strong> on <strong>Almas,</strong> taking his <strong>10-year-old</strong> <strong>Padawan</strong> with him.

His <strong>Trandoshan bodyguard</strong> stands nearby (within 6 squares), and <strong>four Gamorrean warriors</strong> linger near the walls, expecting to hear that their comrades below have subdued the heroes.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the heroes enter the audience chamber, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>The darkened audience chamber is much different than when the Hutt crime lord holds court in it.

Instead, the chamber remains nearly silent, dimly lit and free of the excess that the Hutt brings to the room. The dais sits empty, and small shafts of light shine down from the ceiling, creating brightly illuminated circles on the floor that provide only faint light around them.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Igren Demos</h4>\n<p><strong>Igren Demos</strong> has been <strong>Darga the Hutt’s</strong> majordomo for<strong> </strong>some years now.

In fact, it was <strong>Demos </strong>who discovered the ruined <strong>palace </strong>in <strong>Zarra</strong>, allowing <strong>Darga </strong>to seize it for his own. Over the years, <strong>Demos </strong>has been plotting to overthrow <strong>Darga </strong>and take control of the organization, but for the time being, the majordomo is content to influence events in ways that even the <strong>Hutt</strong> does not suspect.</p>\n<p>The secret to <strong>Demos</strong>’ success is his <strong>Force-</strong>sensitivity. Though he has never shared the truth with anyone, the Jedi identified him as a potential recruit when he was a child, but his Neimoidian parents refused to let the Jedi take him. Growing up, he learned to use the <strong>Force </strong>to exert his will over others, and when he came into <strong>Darga’s </strong>service, he brought the same skills into play to build a criminal empire. <strong>Demos </strong>is not powerful enough to influence his <strong>Hutt</strong> master, but he continues to use his <strong>Force-</strong>sensitivity in secret to ensure that events occur according to his desires, not necessarily those of the crime lord.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This slender Neimoidian is dressed in robes of dark greens and blues, with a ceremonial headdress that makes him seem taller than he truly is.

He uses <strong>Sever Force </strong>to turn aside <strong>Force powers</strong>. Otherwise, he uses <strong>Force Push/Pull</strong> to deal small amounts of damage to the heroes.

The <strong>bodyguard</strong> serves <strong>Demos </strong>personally and has done so ever since the <strong>palace </strong>on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> was established. The <strong>bodyguard</strong> is all business, and unlike most <strong>Trandoshans,</strong> he seems to have abandoned some of his brutal and bloodthirsty nature in favor of protecting his charge at all costs.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This tall Trandoshan is armed with a blaster rifle and wears battle armor decorated with a variety of traditional Trandoshan sigils.

{"_id":"OGdjBMty1OPUU4YU","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> is the fourth adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e </strong></em>experience. This adventure begins the second act of the campaign, which consists of four adventures: <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>, <em><strong>The First to Strike</strong></em>, <em><strong>The Core of Corruption,</strong></em> and <em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>By now, the heroes have been on a series of adventures together and should be well acquainted with one another. <strong>Several months</strong> have passed since the last adventure, and the heroes should start <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> at <strong>7th level</strong> and reach <strong>9th level</strong> by the conclusion. With some modifications, this adventure can also be used as a stand-alone scenario or as part of your existing campaign. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will visit the ruins of a Jedi academy on the planet <strong>Almas</strong> in search of a Jedi <strong>holocron,</strong> confront evil forces brought forth by a Sith <strong>holocron gatekeeper,</strong> and come face to face with Inquisitor <strong>Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<h2>Campaign Update</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi </strong></em>opens some months after the last adventure, <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>. The few Jedi who managed to survive <strong>Order 66</strong> are in hiding, hunted down by the Emperor’s <strong>Inquisitors</strong> and <strong>stormtroopers</strong>—and by bounty hunters encouraged by the large sums offered. One Jedi was recently found inside <strong>Darga the Hutt’s palace </strong>on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, but luckily it was by an organization opposed to the Emperor’s tyrannical rule. Thus, <strong>Jedi Master</strong> <strong>Denia</strong> joined <strong>Senator Bail Organa’s</strong> small rebellion, now headquartered in a secret fleet of ships spearheaded by the Nebulon-B cruiser <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. The fleet’s focus is the investigation of a top-secret Imperial military operation called the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong>. The existence of the project has been revealed to <strong>Organa </strong>by an Imperial defector, <strong>Admiral Gilder Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes who rescued <strong>Master Denia </strong>have spent the past <strong>months</strong> investigating the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and pursuing other ventures to further their individual careers, though they never lost contact with<strong> Senator Organa</strong>. However, <strong>Captain Sirona Okeefe</strong>, who transported the heroes aboard her ship the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> during their early adventures, has decided to part ways and take her chances with a more lucrative smuggling business. Left without a fast transport, the heroes should have been able to purchase their own starship in <strong>recent months</strong>, either by using the ships gained from <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, with credits they acquired or by getting a bank loan. (If necessary, <strong>Senator Organa </strong>used his influence to smooth out any difficulty the heroes might have had and recommended a reputable banking institution. He might even have lent them the credits for a down payment, which could have unfolded as part of a side quest.)</p>\n<p>For the player's new ship, you can use the YT-1300 statistics presented below if they don't have a ship and you need to give them one.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[ZoTffdxLdT2Q0DiR]{YT-1300}</strong></p>\n<p>Aside from furthering the training of Jedi heroes, <strong>Master Denia</strong>, now back to full health, has been meditating on the possibility of a link between the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and the <strong>slaves</strong> rescued by the heroes (at the end of the last adventure). But her ability of farseeing through the <strong>Force</strong> is limited, and she has encountered roadblocks where there should be answers. One possible solution has been revealed to her: If she were to obtain a rare Jedi <strong>holocron,</strong> she might be able to augment her <strong>Force</strong> abilities. By doing so, she could better assist <strong>Senator Organa</strong> and the heroes with their goal of foiling the Empire’s nefarious plans. To accomplish this, she requests the heroes’ help.</p>\n<p>Unknown to the heroes, <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong> felt a strong tremor in the <strong>Force</strong> while they were all in close proximity over <strong>Bespin</strong>—a tremor the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> hasn’t felt since in the presence of his old master. In the course of <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>, the heroes will come face to face with the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> for the first time inside the ruins of the <strong>Jedi academy</strong> on <strong>Almas.</strong> Although the meeting appears to be one of pure chance, there might be a greater force at work.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the campaign’s second act, the heroes will learn a bit more about <strong>Denia’s </strong>past, her tutelage of <strong>Inquisitor Draco,</strong> and the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> Additionally, this campaign arc concludes much like <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em>, with a series of bad things happening to the heroes. The events of this act are darker in tone but shouldn’t be a series of nothing but down notes. The heroes should reel from their battles, but they also should have a chance to succeed and make progress.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> will give existing<strong> force using </strong>heroes a chance to use their abilities to the fullest and allow new <strong>force users</strong> trained by <strong>Master Denia</strong> to practice what they have learned. But the adventure is not designed for<strong> force users </strong>alone. Heroes of other classes will also contribute their unique talents and skills to resolve conflicts.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>Abandoned and half buried in the sands of <strong>Almas</strong> for more than a <strong>millennium, Darth Rivan’s</strong> fortress has been recently invaded and pillaged by <strong>Jedi</strong> and <strong>Sith cultists.</strong> His tomes, amulets, and other artifacts have been stolen. Even the corrupt spirit of his failed apprentice <strong>Darsin,</strong> left behind as the stronghold’s guardian has been defeated. But <strong>Rivan’s</strong> sarcophagus has been found empty.</p>\n<p>In truth, the remnants of his dark influence has lingered for centuries in a diluted state in the cold, desert wastes surrounding the fortress, inching gradually toward the <strong>Force nexus</strong> over which the <strong>Jedi</strong> built their <strong>academy.</strong> This dark energy is responsible for the death of the world’s <strong>kaluthin plant</strong>—which <strong>Rivan</strong> himself engineered so long ago—as death and decay slowly spreads outward from his fortress. The recent destruction of the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> has strengthened this evil energy in this region. The spread of the dark side across <strong>Almas</strong> has left behind a blight of withered <strong>kaluthin</strong> that is visible from orbit. The power of the dark side in <strong>Almas</strong> has also attracted other creatures that feed on the <strong>Force,</strong> and they have followed it to its source in the bowels of the ravaged <strong>Jedi academy.</strong></p>\n<p>The residents of the city of <strong>Forard,</strong> still reeling from the destruction of the <strong>academy</strong> at its center during <strong>Order 66,</strong> made an effort to go on with their lives, but they couldn’t escape the impact of the <strong>dark side.</strong> Over a <strong>few short months</strong>, many local citizens inexplicably became violent, crime rose far beyond what local police could handle, and some people simply dropped dead. Fear and death quickly left the city deserted as residents relocated to other planets in the system with help from the now-independent <strong>Cularin Militia.</strong></p>\n<p>After <strong>months</strong> of interrogating <strong>Force-sensitive prisoners</strong>, <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> learned of a <strong>holocron</strong> in the <strong>Cularin system</strong> that supposedly contained ancient Sith knowledge. He swept the system for <strong>Jedi</strong> who might have survived the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> bombardment but did not find the refugees protected by <strong>Cularin’s</strong> natives, the Tarasin. <strong>Draco</strong> arrived at the <strong>academy</strong> ruins and was immediately entranced by an intoxicating surge of the <strong>dark side.</strong> Attempting to locate the source of this power, <strong>Draco</strong> went into the sublevels of the <strong>Jedi academy,</strong> where he chanced upon a fortunate discovery.</p>\n<p>Deep within the <strong>academy</strong> was the Sith <strong>holocron</strong> he sought, which once belonged to the Sith Lord <strong>Darth Rivan.</strong> Moreover, the growing <strong>dark side</strong> energy on <strong>Almas</strong> had suffused the <strong>Rivan holocron</strong> with a powerful evil. As a result, the <strong>holocron’s gatekeeper</strong> took on a life of its own, believing itself to be the actual spirit of <strong>Darth Rivan,</strong> and it gained the power to activate itself and act of its own free will. <strong>Draco</strong> learned much from the faux <strong>Sith Lord</strong> spirit, and he remained in the academy to study the <strong>holocron</strong> further.</p>\n<p><strong>Master Vhiin’Thorla,</strong> a Twi’lek <strong>Jedi,</strong> who had been away on his homeworld when <strong>Order 66</strong> took place, visited the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> with his <strong>Padawan</strong> in hopes of finding survivors. When <strong>Draco</strong> encountered them, a fierce lightsaber duel ensued, and <strong>Draco’s protégé Raik Muun</strong> used trickery to induce <strong>Thorla’s Padawan</strong> into a murderous rage directed at his own master. <strong>Thorla</strong> was forced to kill his own <strong>Padawan</strong> in self-defense, and, wracked with grief, was easily captured. <strong>Draco</strong> imprisoned the <strong>Jedi Master</strong> in a <strong>Force-annulling Universal Energy Cage.</strong> For a <strong>week</strong> leading up to the heroes’ arrival, <strong>Draco</strong> has conspired with the <strong>holocron gatekeeper</strong> to break <strong>Thorla</strong> and turn him to the <strong>dark side.</strong></p>\n<h3>Adventure Summary</h3>\n<p><em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> opens with the heroes being sent to the planet <strong>Almas,</strong> in the <strong>Cularin</strong> system, to retrieve an ancient <strong>holocron</strong> from the ruins of the <strong>Jedi academy</strong> that once stood there. En route they are attacked by pirates, and eventually, they make their way down to the surface of the planet. Delving deep into the ruined <strong>academy,</strong> they fight off evil <strong>dark side</strong> creatures, zealous followers of an ancient <strong>Sith lord,</strong> monstrous beasts, and the crumbling ruins of the <strong>academy</strong> itself. Finally, they encounter <strong>Inquisitor Draco,</strong> who has fallen strongly under the sway of an evil <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper.</strong> After doing battle with <strong>Draco,</strong> the heroes should recover the <strong>holocron</strong> and escape the collapsing academy, returning with the artifact to the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em></p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[W3sYNPwdqdJX7Vza]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"CqLtwMndnIAIyLTB","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The heroes can ignore the doors, swing left around the outside of the <strong>meditation chambers,</strong> and go directly toward the stairwell (see “<strong>Storage Rooms</strong>,\" below). Each meditation room is <strong>10 feet</strong> by <strong>25 feet </strong>and totally empty aside from a few personal effects, now caked with dust, that were left behind in a hurry. These inexpensive items (not worth more than <strong>5 credits</strong>) might include a <em>personal groomer</em>, a planetary landscape<em> holo-mag</em>, and a <em>recording rod</em> loaded with relaxing music.</p>\n<p>The most important area of <strong>sublevel 1</strong> is the<strong> library</strong>, located directly across from the southern <strong>meditation rooms.</strong> The <strong>blast door</strong> to the <strong>library</strong> is locked, but it must be forced or powered on (see <strong>“Control Room,\"</strong> above) before a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> can bypass the lock.</p>\n<p>The <strong>library</strong> is <strong>40 foot</strong> by <strong>40 foot</strong> room.

Half the <strong>library</strong> has been blown away by blaster fire, while the rest has fallen victim to looters, <strong>Sith cultists,</strong> Almasians, and, finally, Inquisitor <strong>Valin Draco.</strong> Draco learned the specific hidden location of the <strong>Qornah Holocron</strong> from <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron gatekeeper</strong> and took the ancient teaching apparatus down to the <strong>deepest sublevel.</strong></p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the <strong>Jedi library,</strong> read the following:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This library isn’t as large as its austere counterpart on Coruscant, but the ruination that greets you is no less dismaying. Even in dim light, you can make out a room that once was filled from floor to ceiling with shelves that housed hundreds of holobooks overflowing with Jedi wisdom. Now, the repository has been pulverized into dust by blaster fire, and the shelves rest toppled at precarious angles throughout the chamber, shattered against research stations and the marble floor. The shelves are kept company by overturned chairs and damaged computers spitting sparks. About 8 feet above you is an open second floor, where even more despoiled shelves, holobooks, and datacards lie. More bloodscrawled graffiti again attests to cultist desecration. The second floor has a catwalk that cannot be reached without a hoversled. Beneath the walkway ledge, at the eastern wall, a wooden door has been splintered open. Framing it are two bronzium busts, presumably of noble Jedi, one of them decapitated. A small plaque identifies the bust as Jedi Master Qornah. The head lies on the floor, severed in half. Oddly, the inside of the sculpture appears to have sheltered something cubical.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the heroes inspect the bust of <strong>Master Qornah,</strong> they notice a hidden compartment that is in the shape of a cube 4 inches to a side—just the right size for a <strong>Jedi holocron,</strong> as described by <strong>Master Denia</strong>. At the time of the attack on the academy, the <strong>Jedi</strong> librarian was studying the <strong>Qornah Holocron</strong> and quickly tucked it away at the first sign of danger. The <strong>Sith holocron gatekeeper</strong> told <strong>Draco</strong> exactly where to find the <strong>Qornah Holocron,</strong> and the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> cleaved the bust and claimed it.</p>\n<p>The splintered east door leads into a study where older documents were held. Unlike <em>datacards,</em> flimsiplast burns easily (even more so in <strong>Almas’</strong> oxygen-rich atmosphere), so the destruction here is worse. The study also served as the analysis room, and destroyed computers sit on collapsed desks.</p>\n<p>Behind the west wall is another room, hidden behind a bookshelf, with no visible entrance. The heroes can determine the existence of the secret room by comparing the map (which combines the three rooms of the library into one large room with no walls or doors) to the size and shape of the actual room. The heroes might also notice the distance between the library door and either end of the corridor outside. A successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> reveals that a hidden room exists behind the west wall, but not how to gain entrance.

Otherwise, a successful<strong> DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to search the wall—coupled with a lot of patience—reveals the mechanism that activates the shelf.</p>\n<p>The door has to be powered on or forced (see “<strong>Control Room</strong>,\" above). If the door is powered on, a successful <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (security kit) check </strong>allows the heroes to bypass the lock.

{"_id":"PK5ljEw7wDrJcsDM","name":"Part 1: Into the Core","content":"<h1>Part 1: Into the Core</h1>\n<p>In <em><strong>The Core of Corruption</strong></em>, the heroes learn the significance of the data that they received on <strong>Nizon,</strong> prompting them to take the search for the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> to <strong>Coruscant.</strong> They have had very little downtime since their return to the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> and the conclusion of their previous adventure. It takes only a <strong>day</strong> or <strong>two</strong> for <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> and the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> crew to analyze the data. Upon learning its results, the <strong>Admiral</strong> wastes no time in reassembling the heroes in the briefing room to give them their next assignment. If the heroes did not participate in the events on <strong>Nizon,</strong> they need only be told that the information was obtained by another group of agents during the recent <strong>Nazren</strong> uprising on <strong>Nizon.</strong></p>\n<p>The heroes have had little time to heal or recover. Due to the sensitive nature of the data, speed is essential. Any heroes who may require extended healing, repair, or recovery will find that they must patch up themselves and their equipment as best as they can before they go. They have time to meet with anyone who is already aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence,</strong></em> but they are not allowed to communicate with anyone outside of the ship.</p>\n<h2>The Briefing</h2>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> calls the heroes to the briefing room within <strong>24</strong> to <strong>48 hours</strong> after they return to the ship. The <strong>Admiral</strong> is impatiently awaiting their arrival, along with the now-familiar yellow and silver astromech assisting droid.  <em><strong>R</strong><strong>esurgence</strong> </em><strong>Captain Verana</strong> is also in attendance. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As you enter the stark white briefing room, Admiral Varth waits impatiently for you to take your seats. The Admiral looks extremely tired and sleep-deprived. It takes you a moment to realize that Captain Verana sits nearby, near the familiar assisting astromech droid. Admiral Varth begins.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Congratulations. The data you obtained on Nizon is very revealing, so much so that I fear that once the Empire realizes it has been compromised, they will take steps to invalidate it. I’m afraid that time is not on our side.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Thanks to you, we now know the origin of the Sarlacc Project, if not its final purpose.” The Admiral signals the droid, and the holoprojector activates, showing a very familiar city-planet. “I suppose we should not be surprised that the project’s origin and design team resides on Imper—I mean, Coruscant. I do not believe that the entire project is housed there, given the casualty figures I have seen in my former Imperial life. However, it is apparent from the new data that the project is controlled from somewhere in this area.”</em></p>\n<p><em>The Admiral waves at the droid, and the view zooms to the planet’s surface, highlighting a large district that includes some of the Empire’s most important governmental structures, such as the Imperial Senate. “Unfortunately, we do not have an exact fix on the building or agency directly responsible for the project. The leads we have are impossible to pursue remotely. Therefore, we must send you in as soon as possible.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Captain Verana speaks in a serious tone. “Before we delve into the details, you should know that our benefactor has fully authorized this mission, and he wanted me to personally assure you of its importance.”</em></p>\n<p><em>The holoprojector zooms out to show thousands of starships, space stations, and satellites orbiting or approaching Coruscant. “Coruscant is, of course, the center of the Empire. If you have not been to the system since the days of the Republic, the amount of traffic and the level of security may astound you. Peace and order, even under an oppressive government, have brought new opportunities to corporations and individuals throughout the galaxy. Between the prosperity of the Core Worlds and the rebuilding of the planets damaged by the Clone Wars, traffic to Coruscant has increased many times what it was only a few years ago. Security has also increased, so it will be vital that you have the proper documentation and permits to approach the system and land at a suitable port. I will provide this for you.”</em></p>\n<p><em>With that, the Admiral finally takes a seat, leaving the holoprojector on as a nearly silent reminder of your final destination. “Now, I’m sure you have additional questions.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The following questions should be answered by the <strong>Admiral;</strong> however, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> may interject when needed.</p>\n<p><strong>Why should we do this for you? </strong>“<em>We would hope that by now you are fully dedicated to discovering and stopping this project. However, we have been authorized to provide you with 5,000 credits each and equipment and weaponry available from the Resurgence’s stores to replace those that you lost on Nizon. We may also repair your ship, if required.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>When do we leave?</strong> “<em>As soon as you’re ready—hopefully, within the next 24 hours.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>How do we get to Coruscant?</strong> “<em>You should take your own ship. If your ship is unavailable for some reason, we can provide you with an unarmed small light freighter. In either case, we will provide the required licenses. Any borrowed ships must be returned to us.” </em>The provided freighter is a battered YT-1300 called the <strong>Onderon Sky,</strong> use the statistics of the YT-1300 freighter from <em><strong>Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em> minus the weapons.</p>\n<p><strong>What should we expect when approaching Coruscant?</strong> “<em>You should expect tight security when approaching the planet. You must enter the system near a designated hyperspace buoy and contact Imperial Center control immediately. Remember to call it Imperial Center. They will direct you to an approved spacelane to your requested starport. Do not deviate from this flight path. Assume that you are always under surveillance, even though it is unlikely to be focused on you. With the credentials we’re providing, you should not expect any trouble. However, it is always possible that Imperial customs will see fit to inspect the vessel, either by sensors or singling you out for boarding. I highly recommend that you do nothing to draw attention to yourselves. There are literally thousands of Imperial military vessels in the system, so any combat is likely to end swiftly and extremely badly for you.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>How good are our credentials, licenses, and papers?</strong> “<em>Between my own expertise and resources of Captain Verana, we have assembled all the proper licenses and permits, altered for your specific vessel. Our highly placed contacts will enter this data into the BoSS systems before you depart. If you’re using your own vessel, we must make a couple of alterations to your sublight drive to make sure the transponders match. The alteration should be detectable only if someone actually physically examines your transponder. All licenses will be in your proper names, or in alternative identities if you already have ones that can withstand direct Imperial scrutiny.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>What were you (Admiral Varth) going to say instead of ‘Coruscant’? (in the boxed text) </strong>“<em>Sorry, but some habits die hard. I was about to refer to Coruscant as Imperial Center, which of course is its formal Imperial name.</em>” (This is a minor hint as to <strong>Varth’s</strong> ultimate loyalty.)</p>\n<p><strong>How will we know the benefactor’s agents if they contact us?</strong> <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> says, “<em>I’m not exactly sure. I’m told that it may be somebody you have worked with before.” </em>Sometime after the briefing when the <strong>Admiral</strong> is not around, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> tells the heroes that <strong>Tero Reskan</strong> will be their contact. He also gives them a <strong>comlink code</strong> and the sign/countersign <em>“<strong>We broke our droid./ I hope you meant to.</strong></em>” The <strong>Captain</strong> makes it clear that this information is extremely sensitive, and the heroes are not to reveal the name or passwords to anyone, including the <strong>Admiral.</strong> There is always the possibility of Imperial spies aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Where will we stay on Coruscant?</strong> “<em>We arranged docking at the Cloudscape Platforms, a private starport used by Core World travelers and small-scale merchants. I highly recommend finding some accommodations elsewhere. That way, if you draw the attention of the ISB, they may not immediately locate your ship.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>How do we find the source of the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>An excellent question. The best we can provide is several starting points. For instance, we’ve discovered that the Sarlacc Project data is broadcast in a specific frequency range. You may be able to locate the source, but it will not be easy. It is likely a tight-beam transmission to some sort of messenger droid or secret receiving station. We have also identified individuals whose names have shown up on communiqués and delivery reports. One is ISB Agent Lesan Dos, whose exact connection to the project is unknown. It was also discovered that routing codes pertaining to a protocol droid called CZ-3T6 have been discovered on many outgoing messages. The final possibility is a Sullustan called Resh, who was a former associate of Darga the Hutt and tied into the Hutt’s material delivery services. If you can locate one or more of these individuals, they may be able to lead you in the right direction.</em>”</p>\n<p><strong>What do we do when we find the source of the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>You must find and infiltrate the source, discover exactly what the project is, and learn where it is located. Relay any vital data through our benefactor’s contacts on Coruscant, then send what you can back to the </em>Resurgence.<span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></p>\n<h2>Imperial Center</h2>\n<p>Despite the <strong>Admiral’s</strong> ominous warnings, the heroes’ jump to <strong>Coruscant</strong> starts without any issues. The navigation data is excellent (less than one week old). Once the heroes arrive in-system, an unusual combination of circumstances might make them uncomfortable and a bit nervous. You should play this up at any opportunity.</p>\n<h3>Arrival</h3>\n<p>When the heroes arrive at hyperspace buoy IC-772, a quick scan reveals a scene much like what was on the holoprojector. Hundreds of ships are in the area, following specific spacelanes from the buoy to their ultimate destinations. The standard <strong>Message to Spacers (METSOP) </strong>directs incoming ships to immediately contact <strong>Imperial Center control.</strong> If they linger too long, they receive a stern hail from one of the space traffic control droids requesting identification and destination, after which the heroes are ordered to <strong>Imperial Center Approach Vector ICAV-7A</strong>, lest they become an obstacle for incoming ships. In fact, the heroes should realize that a new ship drops from hyperspace near the buoy once every <strong>few minutes</strong>.</p>\n<p>As the heroes approach the spacelane, their ship’s collision warning abruptly sounds. An enormous Action VI bulk transport drops out of hyperspace out of position and crosses their path at an odd angle. <strong>A DC 25 Intelligence (Piloting) check</strong> is required to avoid a collision off the ship’s stern. If the ships collide, the heroes’ ship takes <strong>36 ([[/r 5d8[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]) damage</strong> (if the player's ship has shields, the <strong>damage</strong> is reduced by <strong>half).</strong> A collision also attracts the attention of a nearby Imperial System Patrol Craft, which stops both ships to scan for <strong>damage</strong> and take a report from each.</p>\n<p>Whether or not they collide, the sudden strain on the heroes’ sublight drive is enough to blow out multiple couplings and motivators. A <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check </strong>reveals that the control systems are damaged, but they can be repaired in-flight. A <strong>DC 30 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check </strong>temporarily bypasses some of the damage. Periodic <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Piloting) checks</strong> are required to keep the ship on course while repairs are made. Repairs require a <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (mechanic's kit)</strong> and take about an<strong> hour and a half.</strong> Stopping the ship won’t save a significant amount of time.</p>\n<h3>Approach</h3>\n<p>The heroes follow the prescribed path transmitted to their navigation system. It takes <strong>two hours</strong> to get to <strong>Imperial Center</strong> orbit. Along the way, pairs of TIE fighters and Imperial customs ships occasionally sweep the spacelane, scanning ships of interest. If the heroes’ ship deviates during the approach or if you want to add some tension, a customs ship investigates. It hails the heroes, scans their ship, and electronically verifies their transponder and licenses. Unless the heroes do something foolish, they should pass without incident. If the heroes manage to start a fight, eight TIE fighter reinforcements arrive in <strong>2 rounds</strong> and an Imperial Star Destroyer begins to head their way, though it is too far away to do anything for several minutes other than demand their surrender. About halfway into their journey, the Star Destroyer <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> drops from hyperspace nearby and proceeds at maximum sublight speed toward <strong>Coruscant.</strong></p>\n<p>The heroes (and all other ships) are immediately ordered to halt while the ship passes. When the ship passes briefly within<strong> 60 miles</strong>, <strong>force</strong> sensitive characters must make a<strong> DC 20 Wisdom (Deception)</strong> or<strong> Charisma (Deception) check</strong>. Do not tell them if they succeed or fail, but they should be left questioning who might have been aboard the Star Destroyer. The ship leaves their range before any heroes can attempt to detect what happened through the <strong>force.</strong> Increase their unease by having a customs ship or TIE fighter patrol do a fly-by afterward. Ideally, this encounter will encourage the heroes to keep a very low profile.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes’ ship reaches orbit, Imperial Central control orders them into <strong>Landing Vector ICLV-0192R</strong>. They follow it down to one of the many skylanes jammed with traffic.</p>\n<h2>Cloudscape Platforms</h2>\n<p>Using the skylanes, the heroes must follow their directions to reach the <strong>Cloudscape Platforms.</strong> No fancy flying is allowed, and if anyone does anything outrageous or otherwise leaves the skylane, an airspeeder patrol quickly pursues them and orders them to land at a nearby garrison, where the ship is thoroughly searched, their IDs are scrutinized, and the captain is fined <strong>15,000 credits</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is late evening as they approach the platform. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As you pass through the infinite cityscape of Imperial Center, the sun glows red as it drops behind the horizon.

Impossibly tall metal and glass skyscrapers glow with a firelike intensity in the setting sun.</em></p>\n<p><em>Following the skylane, you approach a tall spire flanked with dozens of vaguely cloud-shaped exterior landing platforms at a multitude of levels. Each is a massive cantilevered structure, which also forms a single bridge to the spire itself.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In stark contrast to the central control droids, a female Human voice politely greets the heroes as they approach and invites them to land at platform <strong>CP32L.</strong> Even though this is a private facility, <strong>Imperial customs agents</strong> still inspect almost every vessel that passes through, and the Cloudscape admin tells them as much, if asked. When the ship lands on an outdoor circular platform about twice its size, <strong>Imperial Customs Agent Talee</strong> is impatiently waiting nearby, flanked by <strong>four stormtroopers</strong>. Although this is standard procedure on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> the heroes may not know it, and it should put them on edge.</p>\n<p><strong>Talee’s</strong> demeanor is cold and professional. He’s dedicated but otherwise very average. He demands that everyone disembark while the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> sweep the vessel. He inspects the heroes’<strong> personal IDs </strong>and <strong>licenses</strong> (for weapons and such) as well as those belonging to the ship. He personally inspects any cargo and compares it to the manifest. Make <strong>Wisdom (Perception) </strong>rolls versus the heroes <strong>Dexterity (Stealth)</strong> rolls for any items they may have attempted to hide on their person or in the ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Talee</strong> asks questions regarding any irregularities, fishing for more information. This is a good opportunity for charismatic characters to attempt to smooth over rough spots or divert attention from troublesome issues. <strong>Talee</strong> issues fines for infractions regarding the ship or personal licenses. These fines range from <strong>500</strong> to <strong>1,000 credits</strong> each and must be <strong>paid via credit</strong> account to <strong>Imperial Customs</strong> within <strong>four hours,</strong> not directly to him. He is by the book and <strong>accepts no bribes</strong>. If any hero shows up in the computer system as wanted, <strong>Talee</strong> orders that hero to be arrested by the <strong>stormtroopers.</strong> If the heroes resist or make any trouble, backup lands on the platform after <strong>20 rounds</strong> (see the <strong>Rapid Response Force</strong> encounter, page 16), assuming that Talee is able to call for help. Essentially, the heroes should be nervous about the inspection and perusal of their paperwork, but unless something is really wrong, they will probably get off with a few fines and a lot of wasted time.</p>\n<p>If the players engage <strong>Talee</strong> in combat, use the <strong>Junior Officer</strong> statblock for him and for the four <strong>stormtroopers</strong> that accompany him, use <strong>two trooper</strong> statblocks and <strong>two heavy trooper</strong> statblocks from <em><strong>Scum and Villainy</strong></em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ad-hoc XP Award:</strong> Characters who complete the landing and inspection without being arrested or incurring fines totaling more than <strong>15,000 credits</strong> receive experience points as though they had defeated a CR 11 encounter. Reduce this reward if they took unnecessary risks or sustained large fines. Do not grant this award if they enter combat.</p>\n<p>For details on Rapid Response Force, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[qTLM3QxFCfLN9iO8]{6-01 Rapid Response Force}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Making Trouble</strong></p>\n<p>Heroes making trouble on <strong>Coruscant</strong> should expect a swift Imperial response.

The <strong>warlord</strong> is a commander of soldiers and treats the <strong>Gamorreans</strong> in <strong>Darga’s </strong>service like his own private army. Though <strong>Darga </strong>has had to warn him in the past about getting too ambitious, the <strong>warlord’s</strong> resolve to defeat any threat to his new clan’s dominance ensures that the <strong>Hutt</strong> always has a dangerous security force at his disposal.

From what they could decode, it appears that the Inquisitorius is growing impatient with Master Denia’s resistance to interrogation. Draco is almost certainly escalating to more brutal techniques, and it is only a matter of time before he breaks her—or kills her in the attempt. She is strong, but she probably has days, not weeks.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why are the codes so important?</strong> “<em>Due to its astrography, the Deep Core has a very limited number of viable hyperspace routes in and out, and a ship’s captain can’t even download the necessary astrogational charts without proper clearance. Since the routes are so limited in number, the Empire can easily patrol them.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can we try to plot a new hyperspace route that the Empire doesn’t know about?</strong> “<em>Plotting new hyperspace routes is a very dangerous and long process, taking weeks or months even under the best of circumstances. In the Deep Core, with so many stars clustered so closely together, the process would be even slower, and the chances of a catastrophic failure are much, much higher.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Could we hire a transport that already has these codes? </strong>“<em>Possibly, but seats fill up quickly, so it would take weeks or months to get there this way. Even if we chartered a private transport, it would take some time to find one willing to risk carrying high-profile fugitives into or out of the Deep Core.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>Is there anyone who could give us the codes?</strong> “<em>Yes.

Alya herself uses her family name and fortune to pursue a life of decadence and excess, making herself into a celebrity and icon while the gossip media watches her every move. This is a problem for us because I need you to meet her.</em></p>\n<p><em>I have reason to believe that, among her other contacts, she has a cadre of personal smugglers who ferry illegal spice, stolen artwork, and other illicit luxuries.

Get them talking about you, and eventually, she will seek you out.</em></p>\n<p><em>Let me put it another way: You have 24 hours to prepare your background and learn about the guests well enough to blend in with nobles, politicians, celebrities, and Imperials in close quarters on a luxury repulsortrain, all the while making a good impression and attracting the attention of a flighty celebrity heiress so that you can ask her, in private, to provide proper codes for illegally infiltrating the Deep Core. Any questions?”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Give the heroes a final opportunity to ask follow-up questions, using the following guidelines to determine <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> response.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why us? Why not you or some other agent?</strong> “<em>A senator being seen meeting privately with a ‘celebutante’ would make for scandalous headlines, drawing unwanted attention. New faces generating a lot of buzz among high-profile guests should be more than enough to get her attention.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What should we do to set up our false identities?</strong> “<em>Whatever aliases you pick for yourselves, my office can create basic matching identification that shows you to be senior aides in my senate office, living in an on-site dormitory. This will pass casual inspection but not a check of electronic records. It would be best if you could fabricate a bit of history and plant records that make you seem legitimate.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How do we learn about the guests? </strong>“<em>The launch of the </em>Gem of Alderaan<em> is a major event, so you can find press releases and news items about those in attendance. Start by searching local computer networks and news feeds. Since the event is happening just over a day from now, many guests have already arrived, so you might be able to pick up names by asking around, particularly in the lounges of upscale hotels in Aldera.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What will security be like?</strong> “<em>Expect security to be very tight. Other than very simple, common devices—comlinks, credit chips, datapads, recorders, and the like— don’t expect to be able to bring any significant tools or equipment. It will be very difficult to smuggle all but the smallest and simplest of weapons on board.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the heroes are ready, <strong>Senator Organa </strong>sends them on their way with the invitations, their new identification cards, and <strong>10,000 credits</strong> for new clothes, bribes, tips, or other expenses. He strongly recommends that the heroes save as much as possible for the launch itself, spending and tipping generously to reinforce their image. (If possible, the heroes should also bring their own money to supplement this amount.)</p>\n<p>The heroes now have about <strong>24 hours </strong>before the launch, which they can spend in any way they wish. Two tasks that will make their job much easier are finding out details about the guest list—particularly highprofile guests—and preparing a solid, inspection-worthy background for their assumed identities. The heroes can address these tasks in whatever order they prefer, and they can even be undertaken simultaneously.</p>\n<h2>The Guest List</h2>\n<p>Although the guest list for this invitation-only <strong>gala</strong> isn’t a secret, it isn’t publicized, either. Finding the necessary details requires a little legwork.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> Six different channels can provide information about the guest list, but no one approached supplies the entire list. Out of the six, the heroes must successfully complete four to get the entire guest list. They do not have to be done in order, and the heroes can split up and attempt multiple channels simultaneously if they wish.</p>\n<p>Have the players describe what they want their character's to do in order to compile the guest list then call for <strong>ability checks</strong> appropriate to what they are doing. Do not inform the players if they succeed or fail at these <strong>checks</strong> and as they progress, feel free to add threats, opportunities or play off conflicts caused by player <strong>actions. </strong>Sample <strong>checks </strong>are listed below. Additionally a player suggest using a <strong>class feature</strong> or <strong>power</strong> instead of making a <strong>check,</strong> if it makes sense allow it to count as an <strong>automatic success </strong>when tallying how successful they were.</p>\n<p>The hero can ask around, finding taxi drivers, club patrons, and hotel visitors who have spotted notable out-of-town guests that have been seen in the area. Have the players make a<strong> DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>A search of computer networks can uncover press conferences, articles, and other pieces that identify individuals attending the <strong>gala.</strong> Have the players make a <strong>DC 24 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>A brief search turns up a nighttime desk clerk who is short on cash, and the hero can bribe him to provide a list of attendees staying at his hotel. Have the players bribe the desk clerk with an amount of credits you deem appropriate and make a <strong>DC 23 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>Pretending to be a hurried or confused attendee unable to locate a group of friends, the hero can fast-talk a concierge into revealing other passengers. Have the players make a <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Deception) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The hero can stake out the hotel district with a pair of electrobinoculars to try to identify notables and their entourages. Have the players make a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Only possible between 12:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.</strong> The hero can sneak into restricted areas of the repulsortrain station to find unsecured passenger information. Have the players make a <strong>DC 24 Dexterity (Stealth) check.</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes do not succeed in getting the entire list, they can still learn some useful information:</p>\n<p><strong>1 success: </strong>The heroes learn the total number of attendees (<strong>107</strong>) and the identity of <strong>one major guest</strong>. Choose the guest randomly from the “<em><strong>Who’s Who</strong></em>” textbox.</p>\n<p><strong>2 successes: </strong>As above, but with the identity of <strong>two major guests</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>3 successes:</strong> As above, but with the identity of <strong>three major guests</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> If the heroes know the identity of one or more major guests, they can attempt to learn specific details about a particular guest’s interests, likes, and dislikes. (This makes later social interaction somewhat easier.) Consider the following sample checks or make your own.</p>\n<p>Searching public data sources is the simplest approach. Have the players make a <strong>DC 21 Intelligence (Technology) check.</strong></p>\n<p>Appealing to the least common denominator—or telling someone what they want to hear—can influence those close to the guests to talk about what they know. Have the players make a<strong> DC 22 Charisma (Deception) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>Tail your target to profile his or her actions and interests, using your skills to blend in with the crowd and avoid detection. Have the players make a <strong>DC 24 Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>If any ability <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>5 or more</strong>, that guest’s security detail becomes aware that someone is paying too much attention to their charge. The resulting lockdown makes it impossible to make any further attempts to learn about that guest.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Once the heroes have exhausted all leads, run out of time, or given up, move on to the next part of the adventure. Learning details about a major guest gives the heroes <strong>advantage</strong> on all <strong>Deception, Persuasion, </strong>and <strong>Perception checks </strong>involving that guest in Part 2: Getting to Know You.</p>\n<h2>Making a Name for Yourself</h2>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> In addition to learning about the guests at the <strong>launch gala,</strong> the heroes need to build a plausible cover that allows them to fit in. While the IDs and invitations provided by <strong>Senator Organa </strong>are a good start, no records exist to match the new identities.</p>\n<p>To create, edit, or delete publicly available government records, the heroes must gain authorized access to a government database so that they can insert their information into official records. The computer system in question is operated by a local public safety office.</p>\n<p>To be treated as an authorized user and gain the ability to alter public records, the heroes must make a <strong>DC 24 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong>. A failure by <strong>5 or more</strong> draws the attention of a low-level administrator who makes sure that additional <strong>checks</strong> at this computer be made at <strong>disadvantage.</strong></p>\n<p>The heroes can make this task simpler if they choose a good target for their efforts, using either or both of the skills below. Each <strong>check</strong> can be attempted<strong> only once</strong>.</p>\n<p>A determined search of isolated computer networks finds a more publicly accessible system. A successful <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check </strong>lowers the the slicer's kit <strong>check</strong> to a <strong>DC 20</strong>.</p>\n<p>Familiarity with similar security systems can provide insight on the verification protocols, potentially providing a back door to easy access. A successful <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> grants <strong>advantage</strong> to <strong>checks</strong> involving these computer systems.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Who's Who</strong></p>\n<p>When researching the guest list, the heroes can learn about several major guests who are attending the maiden voyage of the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Major Guests</strong></p>\n<p>The heroes learn the name, occupation, and physical description of any major guest they have identified.

If a player is proficient in <strong>forgery kits</strong>, allow them to add their proficiency to the roll.</p>\n<p>Once the proper records have been created or appropriated for the heroes’ identities, each hero must prepare a disguise—dress, mannerisms, and perhaps stage makeup and prosthetics.

If they fail, the disguise will raise scrutiny with security at the <strong>gala</strong> but do not tell players if they fail. Enterprising players may attempt to use a power, class feature or item to circumvent the use of a disguise but unless it can hold up to physical inspection, it will automatically fail and give away the player's lie. Unless the players already has an appropriately wealthy wardrobe (unlikely for anyone other than a noble or officer), crafting the disguise costs <strong>1,000 credits</strong> for each hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Even without completing these steps, the basic identification and invitations provided by <strong>Senator Organa</strong> are sufficient to get any given hero on board the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>. However, having incomplete backgrounds or “<strong>thin</strong>” identities can cause some difficulties during the social encounters in <strong>@JournalEntry[msvsW3mn92XNqvBm]{Part 2: Getting to Know You}</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Other Preparations</h2>\n<p>In addition to the more important tasks outlined in the following sections, the heroes must take care of several mundane preparations before appearing at the <strong>launch gala</strong> for the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>.</p>\n<h3>Sleep</h3>\n<p>Because of the high pace of the work, the heroes will burn out if they work for more than<strong> eight hours</strong>. For every additional <strong>hour</strong> worked without getting <strong>eight hours </strong>of sleep, a character must make a <strong>DC 10 Constitution saving throw</strong> with the <strong>DC</strong> increasing by <strong>1</strong> for each hour past <strong>8 hours</strong>. On a failed <strong>saving throw,</strong> a character suffers <strong>one level</strong> of <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Shopping</h3>\n<p>The players can purchase legal, <strong>unenhanced</strong> equipment with relative ease, it is impossible to find a vendor or seller for <strong>enhanced</strong> items.</p>\n<h3>Contraband</h3>\n<p>The heroes might wish to spend time figuring a way to smuggle equipment or weapons onto the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>. If a character asks about security or carrying <strong>restricted</strong> items on board, have her make an <strong>Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 13</strong>: Other than <em>communications devices, computers/storage devices,</em> and <em>recording units,</em> very few items are authorized to be carried on board by non-Imperial personnel. It is a relatively short trip, so guests are not expected to bring overnight luggage.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 16</strong>: Security at the event will probably include passing through a sophisticated <strong>weapons scanner</strong> as well as a <strong>check</strong> of the passenger’s identification and invitation. If a passenger’s identification is not supported by <strong>electronic records,</strong> that passenger will attract greater scrutiny.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 19:</strong> Contraband can be smuggled past security, either by planting it on authorized personnel who bypass the scanners or by disguising it as part of a legitimate device. (Ordinary concealment is useless against a weapons scanner.) In either case, the smuggled item must be <strong>very small</strong>, meaning that larger items must be carefully disassembled into smaller parts.</p>\n<p>If a player wishes to smuggle contraband onboard the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>, use the sample <strong>checks</strong> for inspiration.</p>\n<p><strong>Disassembling Items:</strong> An object that would be comparable to <strong>medium size</strong> can be broken down into <strong>tiny sized</strong> components with a <strong>DC 15</strong> <strong>tool check</strong> appropriate to the object (A <em>techblade</em> for example would be broken down by <em>armstech's tools)</em> and takes <strong>one hour</strong>. If the <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>more than</strong> <strong>5</strong>, the object is <strong>damaged</strong> and unusable until repaired. In order to repair an object a <strong>DC 15 tool check</strong> appropriate to the object must be made and also takes an <strong>hour.</strong></p>\n<p>Reassembly requires the same <strong>check</strong> as disassembling with the same consequences for a failed <strong>check.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Disguising Items:</strong> Any object to be smuggled through security must be disguised as part of one or more innocuous devices, such as <em>comlinks</em> or <em>datapads.</em> Objects that are not of <strong>tiny size</strong> cannot be smuggled in and must be disassembled first.</p>\n<p>Disguising an object is a difficult deception, requiring <strong>one hour</strong> and a <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (Deception) check</strong> made with <strong>disadvantage</strong> or a <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (disguise kit) check</strong>. If they fail, the disguised objects will raise scrutiny with security at the <strong>gala</strong> but do not tell players if they fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Planting Items: </strong>A player may attempt make a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check t</strong>o hide or retrieve broken down objects or other contraband on <strong>security personnel</strong> or <strong>guests.</strong> The guards and guests are decently observant but any skilled pickpocket can easily fool them however if a <strong>check</strong> fails by <strong>more than 5</strong>, they are caught in the act.</p>\n<h2>Moving On</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finish their preparations, or when they run out of time, move on to <strong>@JournalEntry[msvsW3mn92XNqvBm]{Part 2: Getting to Know You}</strong>.</p>","folder":"2thVWOSc0Xr3eK8T","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The heroes need to access the computer system and gain access to the <strong>Spire</strong> itself. All the <strong>techs</strong> are at their control stations.

The journey from <strong>Alderaan </strong>to <strong>Felucia </strong>is relatively uneventful and should give the heroes plenty of downtime before their mission begins.</p>\n<p><strong>Felucia </strong>is an out-of-the-way jungle world where massive mushrooms dominate the landscape. The native <strong>Felucians </strong>retreated into hiding many years ago when Gossam colonists<strong> </strong>came to the world. Though the fierce battles of the Clone Wars made their way to the planet eventually, <strong>Felucia </strong>was left largely unscathed, and once the Separatist forces were defeated, the newly created Empire mostly withdrew from the system. As <strong>Bail Organa</strong> explained to the heroes, the Imperial presence on <strong>Felucia</strong> is based primarily around protecting the small <strong>prison facility </strong>left on the world. The few cities on <strong>Felucia </strong>have Imperial garrisons, and the Gossam colonists remaining on the world after the Clone Wars must deal with Imperial persecution.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, the heroes won’t be going anywhere near the cities. The <strong>prison facility</strong>, which does not exist on any official maps, is located deep in the <strong>Felucian jungle</strong>. If not for the <strong>Alderaanian Security agent </strong>frozen in carbonite, neither <strong>Bail Organa</strong> nor the heroes would have any knowledge of the facility’s location. The <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>has the coordinates in its nav computer, and the course plotted by <strong>RX-13</strong> should bring the ship out of hyperspace on the side of the planet nearest to the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Evasive Maneuvers</h2>\n<p>As the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>emerges from hyperspace, <strong>Crash </strong>informs <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> that their trajectory was perfect and that they are approaching in a vector that will take them to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. Almost instantaneously, the sensor board lights up with contacts — Imperial contacts. The massive, dagger-shaped visage of a <strong>Victory-class Star Destroyer</strong> looms above the planet, and within <strong>seconds</strong> the flickering sensor board indicates that the capital ship has turned to intercept the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>. <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> orders everyone to strap in so that she can make evasive maneuvers.</p>\n<p>When the heroes comply, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>As the blue tunnel of hyperspace fades away and the pinpoints of stars fill the windows of the cockpit, you get a brief glimpse of the planet Felucia hanging just below your ship. Almost instantly your eyes are drawn to the dagger-shaped starship looming ahead of you — an Imperial Star Destroyer.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Hold on,” Captain Okeefe says, “We’re in for a bumpy ride.”</em></p>\n<p><em>With that, the captain slams the control stick forward, sending the ship tumbling rapidly into the atmosphere of the planet. As the Banshee passes through the thin cloud layer, you get a good look at the fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia, where towering mushrooms reach up into the air like skyscrapers. It would be beautiful if it weren’t rushing up at you so quickly.</em></p>\n<p><em>Eventually, Captain Okeefe pulls the ship out of its dive, a move accompanied by the sounds of metal shearing from somewhere in the rear of the ship. The transport lurches, nearly throwing each of you to the ground, and dips sickeningly down toward the fungal canopy. Another massive bump jostles the ship before the captain brings the vessel to a screeching halt, resting deep within the mushroom jungles.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Searching for Civilization</h2>\n<p>When the dust settles, <strong>Captain Okeefe </strong>and <strong>Crash </strong>quickly move around the ship, assessing the damage and ensuring that no one is injured. After a <strong>few minutes</strong>, <strong>the captain</strong> opens the hatch and steps outside into the jungle. The thick, humid air seeps into the ship almost immediately, and soon she returns with less than stellar news. While the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>has survived the landing mostly intact, it won’t be taking off any time soon. <strong>Okeefe</strong> thinks she can make the repairs, and fortunately the ship is hidden by the Felucian jungle’s canopy. However, she cannot give the heroes an estimate of when the work will be done. She suggests (if the heroes don’t do so themselves) that they make their way through the jungle toward the <strong>prison</strong>. The ship’s navigational systems brought the vessel down near the <strong>prison facility</strong>, so it shouldn’t take them more than a <strong>day </strong>or so to trek through the jungle and discover the ultimate fate of <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although supplies are limited, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> offers to give the heroes whatever food or water she has. There are enough removable supplies on the ship to provide water and nourishment for a <strong>week’s journey</strong>, though the heroes certainly shouldn’t be gone that long.<strong> The captain</strong> provides them with the directions to the<strong> prison facility</strong>, which she can upload into any datapads carried by the heroes. This should give them the location of the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> and the relative location of the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>so they can make their way back.</p>\n<p>When the heroes first step off of the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Your first steps onto the soil of Felucia make it clear that this planet is truly alive. Massive mushrooms tower overhead, their overhanging edges creating a canopy that blocks out much of the planet’s sunlight. Every step on Felucian soil turns up insects and other fungi just beneath the surface. The noise of the jungle is loud and alien, full of the sounds of a hundred insects and animals moving through the mushroom swamps, all part of a living and vibrant ecosystem.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Traveling through the jungle toward the Imperial <strong>prison </strong>requires frequent <strong>Survival checks</strong> to stay on course and avoid hazards. The journey requires at least<strong> 12 hours’</strong> worth of successful progress from the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>to the facility. The heroes must make a <strong>DC 15 Survival check </strong>each <strong>hour </strong>of travel. Success indicates that they make progress toward their destination, whereas failure results in no progress. If the hero making the <strong>Survival check</strong> fails the <strong>check </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong>, the group might encounter a <strong>hazard</strong>. Sample hazards are described below, but you should feel free to include any other jungle <strong>hazards</strong> appropriate to the planet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Acid Pool (CR 1):</strong> Acid pools are dangerous hazards on <strong>Felucia </strong>because they resemble pools of standing water. Each acid pool can be detected with a successful<strong> DC 10 Perception check</strong>. Any hero who fails this <strong>Perception check</strong> steps in a pool of acid, taking <strong>[[/r 1d6[acid] # Acid damage]] </strong><strong>damage</strong>. Each <strong>round </strong>thereafter, the character must make a <strong>DC 12 Constitution saving throw </strong>or take an additional <strong>[[/r 1d6[acid] # Acid damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>when. The acid stops damaging the target whenever the target succeeds in a <strong>saving throw</strong>, or if the hero washes the acid off with water.</li>\n<li><strong>Exploding Fungus Bloom (CR 2):</strong> These blooms are filled with chemicals that become highly explosive and flammable when combined. When the heroes encounter this hazard, one hero at random bumps into an exploding fungus bloom. The bloom explodes, making a <strong>ranged attack </strong>with a <strong><strong><strong>+3 attack</strong><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> </span><strong>bonus (</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+3 # Exploding Fungus Bloom]]) </strong>and dealing <strong>[[/r 2d6[energy] # Energy damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>as a flash incinerates the fungus.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Mushroom (CR 2): </strong>These fungi are extremely dangerous and, like the exploding fungus blooms, activate only when someone gets too close. If the heroes encounter this hazard, one hero at random passes too close to a razor mushroom. The mushroom bursts outward with spines and razor-sharp tendrils, making a <strong>melee attack</strong> against that hero with a <strong>+3 attack bonus <strong><strong><strong>(</strong></strong>[[/r 1d20+3 # Razor Mushroom]])</strong> </strong>and dealing <strong>[[/r 1d6+2[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a successful <strong>attack</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>Sinkhole (CR 1):</strong> Throughout the jungle are a number of sinkholes, created when the roots of a massive fungus rot away but leave detritus in the ground. Spotting a sinkhole requires a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong>, and success means the sinkhole is avoided. Any hero who fails this <strong>check </strong>falls into the sinkhole, which is f<strong>ifteen feet deep</strong> and leads to a pit with a thin layer of sludge at the bottom. Any hero who falls in takes normal falling <strong>damage (</strong><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">[[/r 1d6[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>In the Wilds</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have made at least<strong> 6 hours’</strong> worth of progress toward their destination, they encounter a group of natives—a <strong>Felucian scout party</strong>, just returning from patrol. Of late, the <strong>Felucian villages</strong> have been plagued by Imperial agents capturing their scouts, and as a result the <strong>Felucians </strong>are extremely wary of outsiders. As the heroes enter a clearing, four <strong>Felucian scouts</strong> emerge from the underbrush, thinking them to be more Imperial agents.</p>\n<h2>Felucian Hospitality</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: @JournalEntry[Xdp7L3jQuHGRtfMH]{1-04 Felucian Hospitality}</p>\n<h3>Development</h3>\n<p>After the heroes defeat the <strong>Felucians</strong>, they should quickly discover that they are on the outskirts of some kind of <strong>village</strong>. Once the noises of battle die down, the heroes can make out sounds just through the jungle. As they follow these sounds, they find a makeshift <strong>village </strong>on the other side of the undergrowth populated with more <strong>Felucians</strong>, as well as a few other surprises.</p>\n<h2>Felucian Sanctuary</h2>\n<p>A hidden village deep within the <strong>Felucian </strong>jungle, this sanctuary is home to more than a dozen <strong>Felucian </strong>families. Additionally, a former Separatist soldier, now a hermit on the fungal world, resides in the <strong>village</strong>, hiding from the Empire. The sanctuary has remained a secret in the months since the Empire took over, and it is a place where the Separatist and the <strong>Felucians </strong>can live without fear of Imperial discovery.</p>\n<p>The <strong>village </strong>provides a place for the heroes to rest and recuperate a bit from their trek through the jungle. Additionally, the sanctuary offers a number of interesting roleplaying opportunities for the heroes, allowing them to interact with the locals and discover more about the conditions on the planet. If the heroes are reluctant to enter the <strong>village </strong>due to their recent conflict with the <strong>Felucian scouts</strong>, feel free to use the following to motivate them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The former Separatist, an older man named <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong> (described under “<strong>The Translator</strong>”), invites the heroes into the <strong>village</strong>, explaining that their fight with the<strong> Felucian scouts </strong>was just a misunderstanding.</li>\n<li>The heroes notice signs that the <strong>Felucians </strong>aren’t friendly to the Empire—such as an effigy, dressed in stormtrooper armor, hanging outside the <strong>village</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can impress upon the heroes the fact that the <strong>village </strong>might be a good place to ensure that their directions are correct and learn about any other hazards leading up to the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the heroes enter the <strong>village</strong>, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The village appears to have been carved almost completely out of the massive mushrooms that dominate the Felucian landscape. Each one looks old and petrified, making the mushroom huts appear far more solid than their still-living counterparts elsewhere in the jungle. In the center of the village, a number of native Felucians gather in a half circle, squatting by a cooking fire and turning to look at you as you enter. Though the village area has been cleared, small mushrooms and other plants still rise up from the ground, as though the jungle itself resisted any attempts at civilization.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While in the <strong>village</strong>, the heroes are approached cautiously until they convince the residents that they mean no harm. If any of the heroes has (or is) a protocol droid or other droid with a translator unit, they find that most of the <strong>villagers </strong>are <strong>indifferent </strong>toward the visitors. Unless the heroes are visibly pretending to be Imperial officials, the <strong>villagers </strong>are more curious about them than anything else. If the heroes can befriend the <strong>Felucians</strong>, the natives are happy to take them in and provide them with food and shelter, at least for a short time. Most of the <strong>villagers</strong> believe any non-Imperial visitors to be victims of Imperial oppression, as they are, and the <strong>Felucians </strong>are always eager to assist anyone who is not an agent of the Empire.</p>\n<p>The encounters described below can occur any time that the heroes are in the <strong>village</strong>. Feel free to use the location as a place where the heroes can recuperate and interact with the locals. In <strong>part 3</strong> of The <em><strong>Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, the heroes will confront captured <strong>Felucians </strong>that have been tormented and twisted by the Empire. Therefore, use this time to let the heroes get to know the natives so that they will be more sympathetic later.</p>\n<h3>The Translator</h3>\n<p>Living among the native <strong>Felucians </strong>is a former Separatist commander named <strong>@Actor[ryiPykBLIK2EBZHZ]{Vazus Mandrake}</strong>. A middle-aged Human male from <strong>Corulag </strong>with a scarred face and stringy gray hair, <strong>Mandrake</strong> was stranded on <strong>Felucia </strong>during the Clone Wars after his mercenary unit was destroyed by clone troopers. Crawling off into the jungle while grievously wounded, <strong>Mandrake </strong>managed to escape execution by the clone troopers and nursed himself back to health. When the war ended and the Empire rose, <strong>Mandrake </strong>decided to make his home among the <strong>Felucians</strong>, where he has been living ever since. He also tends a small group of <strong>kybucks </strong>that he imported to the world when his unit was stationed here. Although his unit fell, the <strong>kybucks </strong>survived, and <strong>Mandrake </strong>has named them all after his former comrades.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not have a translator droid, <strong>Vazus</strong> <strong>Mandrake </strong>approaches them and offers to serve as their go-between with the <strong>villagers</strong>. <strong>Mandrake</strong> is an expert in the <strong>Felucians</strong>’ guttural tongue, and he can converse with them fluently. He is immediately curious about the heroes and their intentions, and if they make it clear that they are not allies of the Empire, he treats them like old friends. Though bitter about his defeat at the hands of the Empire, <strong>Mandrake</strong> is genial and happily translates for the heroes. He is initially <strong>indifferent </strong>towards them, but becomes <strong>friendly </strong>if they mention that they are opposed to the Empire. If the heroes succeed on a <strong>DC 10 persuasion check</strong>, he will not only translate for them but also attempt to aid another on any <strong>Persuasion checks</strong> the heroes make on the <strong>Felucians</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Mandrake </strong>is an important ally for the heroes. In addition to his ability to translate for them, he has some knowledge of the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. If the heroes mention the facility in <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>presence, his face darkens and he becomes very serious. <strong>Mandrake </strong>has wanted to destroy the <strong>prison </strong>for some time now, though his new life among the <strong>Felucians </strong>has cooled his passions somewhat and he is no longer so gung-ho about doing the job himself. If he learns of the heroes’ intentions to raid the facility, he begs them to help him with his sabotage. <strong>Mandrake </strong>produces a large <strong>explosive charge</strong> and explains that if they can set it in the facility’s <strong>communications center</strong>, the blast should be powerful enough to destroy the <strong>prison</strong> and overload Imperial communications on <strong>Felucia</strong> for some time. That will also make it easier for the heroes to escape from <strong>Felucia</strong>. If the heroes agree, <strong>Mandrake</strong> gives them the <strong>explosive charge</strong> and shows them how to set the timer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/vazus%20mandrake/vazus_mandrake_art.webp\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[IpZ1VH3dKjGFCHYK]{06 - Handout 6 - Vazus Mandrake}</p>\n<h3>Scrutiny of the Chief</h3>\n<p>After the heroes have been in the <strong>village </strong>for a short time, they are approached by an elderly Felucian shaman that <strong>Mandrake</strong> (or the heroes’ translator droid) describes as<strong> the chief</strong>. <strong>@Actor[Lh6AQYxTCYVbXxO4]{The Felucian Chief}</strong> is obviously extremely old, and the tendrils around his head appear to be shrunken and damaged. The shaman has also seen his share of battles; his body is covered in scars, and one arm looks withered and blackened as though infected with some kind of shriveling disease.</p>\n<p><strong>The chief </strong>comes to the heroes and scrutinizes them, looking them over without saying a word. If any heroes in the party are <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive, <strong>the chief </strong>pays particular attention to them, and such characters hear faint, guttural whispers as he passes by. On the other hand, if any heroes have a dark <strong>power</strong> or <strong>alignment</strong>, <strong>the chief </strong>appears to scowl at them, his gaze lingering just a bit longer than on the others.</p>\n<p>After a brief examination of the heroes, <strong>the chief </strong>turns to them as a group and begins to speak. Particularly, he wants to know who they are, why they have come to <strong>Felucia</strong>, and what they intend to do about the Empire. (<strong>The chief</strong> secretly hopes that they might help discourage the Empire from staying on <strong>Felucia</strong>, though he shows no signs of it.) This encounter is one of the most important the heroes can have in the <strong>village</strong>, and much depends on how they treat <strong>the chief </strong>and how they answer his questions.</p>\n<h4>Critical Challenge</h4>\n<p>The most beneficial outcome of the meeting with<strong> the chief </strong>is that the heroes gain the trust and help of the <strong>Felucian village</strong>. Specifically, if the heroes succeed in this challenge, <strong>the chief </strong>appoints a scout from the <strong>village </strong>to guide them to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. To achieve this, the heroes must win the friendship of<strong> the chief.</strong> Once<strong> the chief</strong> has been made friendly, he is willing to consider providing them with a guide. <strong>The chief </strong>speaks of the numerous dangers in the jungle (many of which the heroes might have encountered already) and cautions them not to proceed lightly. Although they have made it this far, there are many hazards that they have not yet faced, among them massive predators such as the Felucian <strong>rancor</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes indicate that they will do something more permanent about the Imperial presence on <strong>Felucia</strong> (such as planting <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>explosive charge), <strong>the chief</strong> agrees to provide them with a scout who can lead them directly to the facility. On the other hand, if the heroes keep their intentions closer to the vest (or if they refused <strong>Mandrake’s </strong>request), they can win the aid of<strong> the chief </strong>in other ways.</p>\n<p>If the heroes leave any of their supplies (such as those taken off the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>) for the <strong>villagers</strong>, <strong>the chief</strong> is grateful and grants his aid.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if the heroes offer to help the <strong>village </strong>in any other material way (such as by arming the <strong>Felucians </strong>with advanced weapons or providing them with medicine), <strong>the chief</strong> is grateful and provides his aid.</p>\n<p>If the heroes discover and heal the sick <strong>Felucian children</strong> (see the “Sick Children” encounter, below),<strong> the chief</strong> automatically grants his aid.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 1</h4>\n<p>One other thing the heroes can do during this encounter is learn a bit more about the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. If <strong>the chief</strong> can be made friendly to the heroes and any hero asks about the <strong>prison</strong>, that hero can make a <strong>DC 10 Investigation check </strong>to learn more about the facility. If successful, the heroes learn that the <strong>villagers</strong> call it the “<em><strong>Vanishing Plac</strong><strong>e</strong></em>” and steer clear of it whenever possible.<strong> The chief </strong>explains that many <strong>Felucians </strong>have disappeared in the area around the <strong>Vanishing Place</strong>, and when the <strong>Felucians</strong> sent a few shamans to investigate, they had to leave quickly before they were overwhelmed with pain. <strong>The chief</strong> believes that many of the missing <strong>Felucians </strong>are being held in the <strong>prison facility</strong>, and that the Empire is causing them great pain.<strong> The chief</strong> also tells the heroes that the source of the pain seems most concentrated on the west side of the facility.</p>\n<h4>Auxiliary Challenge 2</h4>\n<p><strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes have an opportunity to impress <strong>the chief</strong> and gain some of his knowledge. If <strong>the chief</strong> is friendly to the heroes, he can be convinced to give up a bit of <strong>Force</strong> lore. Any character who acknowledges his or her own <strong>Force </strong>sensitivity to<strong> the chief </strong>also gains his interest. <strong>The chief </strong>is eager to learn more about the ways of the <strong>Force</strong>, especially from outsiders, and he is willing to trade knowledge. If any hero demonstrates an aptitude for the <strong>Force </strong>that <strong>the chief</strong> himself does not have — perhaps in the form of a <strong>Force power</strong> or other <strong>Force </strong>ability with visible results — that hero receives some <strong>Force </strong>tutelage from <strong>the chief</strong>. Specifically, the hero learns the <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.forcepowers.CJiHSga5F10ZTKMg]{Burst} at-will power </strong>as an additional known <strong>power</strong>. Alternatively, this is a chance for you (the GM) to introduce any new <strong>Force powers</strong> or abilities into the campaign that might be available only to certain Forceusers, especially <strong>powers </strong>or abilities that differ greatly from those in the <em><strong>SW5e Player's Handbook</strong></em>.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p><strong>Ad-Hoc XP Award:</strong> If the heroes succeed in the critical challenge of this encounter and obtain a scout, grant them experience points as though they had overcome a <strong>CR 4 opponent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Sick Children</h3>\n<p>Several of the younger <strong>Felucians</strong> in the <strong>village </strong>have fallen ill in <strong>recent days</strong>, many of them deteriorating to the point of paralysis. The <strong>Felucians</strong> have hidden these children away in one of their mushroom huts, and only a hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> while walking through the <strong>village </strong>notices their anguished cries. If the hero investigates further, he or she discovers four <strong>Felucian children</strong> who lie on cots, frail and nearly immobile except when they cry out in pain. In truth, the children have contracted a virus engineered by <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> in the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> (see Part 3 for more information on <strong>Vischera </strong>and his experiments). The children’s skin has faded to a sickly gray, and their muscles have thinned to the point that they are visibly too weak to support their weight.</p>\n<p>A hero can treat the virus with a <strong>DC 10 Medicine check</strong>, and curing the children requires <strong>8 hours</strong> of tending. Feel free to let the heroes take this time, since there is no real time restraint during this part of the adventure. Although the heroes should feel the illusion of pressure (reaching the <strong>prison facility</strong> before some ill fate befalls <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>), they should not be punished for an altruistic act.</p>\n<h4>Ad-Hoc XP Award</h4>\n<p>If the heroes cure the sick children, award them experience points as if they had defeated a <strong>CR 2 enemy</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Imperial Scout</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have had a chance to interact with the <strong>villagers</strong> and deal with the encounters above, have them make <strong>DC 10 Perception checks</strong>. Any hero who succeeds notices a low whine coming from the outskirts of the <strong>village</strong>, as though a repulsor were passing around its edges. Upon further investigation, the heroes spot a on a <strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@Compendium[sw5e.monsters.OVoCEGeBAWhEVzME]{Speeder Bike}</span></strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> zooming away from the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">village</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">, headed into the deep jungle. They catch only a glimpse of him before he speeds out of view, but it seems certain that the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">scout trooper</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> saw them.</span></p>\n<p>If the heroes don’t realize it immediately, <strong>Vazus Mandrake</strong> does: The <strong>scout trooper </strong>will report the hidden <strong>Felucian village</strong>—and the presence of the heroes—to his superiors, and soon after, <strong>stormtroopers </strong>will descend upon them. Fortunately, though, the mushrooms in the area have chemicals in their stalks that block long-range communications, so there is little chance that the <strong>scout trooper</strong> could report his findings before reaching his base. Thus, <strong>Mandrake </strong>begs the heroes to take his <strong>kybucks</strong> and chase the <strong>scout trooper</strong> down. He assures them that the <strong>kybucks</strong> are tame (which is true) and urges them to catch the Imperial scout before it’s too late.</p>\n<p>If all of the heroes fail the <strong>Perception check </strong>above, they still notice the <strong>scout trooper</strong>, but each hero has <strong>disadvantage </strong>on his or her <strong>Initiative check</strong> when the chase sequence begins.</p>\n<h3>Zone 1: The Chase Begins</h3>\n<p>The heroes mount their <strong>@Actor[lCHQkfQTaRCJjvWu]{Kybucks}</strong>, and the chase begins! Have each hero roll <strong>Initiative </strong>as normal; this will determine not only the order in which they act, but also their <strong>Initiative score</strong> in the encounter at the end of the chase sequence. On the <strong>first round</strong> of the chase sequence, the heroes can mount the <strong>kybucks </strong>as normal. As promised, the <strong>kybucks </strong>are tamed and ready for riding. If the character controls them (restricting the mount to <strong>Dash</strong>, <strong>Disengage</strong>, and <strong>Dodge </strong>actions), a hero can direct his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>out of the <strong>village</strong> and in pursuit of the <strong>scout trooper</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Kybucks </strong>move very, very quickly, and as the beasts lurch forward, the heroes realize that they’ll have no trouble keeping up with a <strong>speeder bike</strong>. Large mushrooms and other huge fungi streak by faster than the eye can see, and the ground whips by at an incredible pace. The <strong>kybucks </strong>provide a relatively smooth ride, and it is clear that the animals know the terrain far better than any of the heroes might. Each <strong>kybuck</strong> leaps, turns, twists, and dodges between the massive growths of the fungal forest. Throughout the chase sequence, be sure to emphasize the speed at which the heroes are moving.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>first round </strong>of the chase, the heroes streak out of the <strong>village </strong>and into an area of sparse growth. Although <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> are not needed to control the <strong>kybucks</strong>, have each hero make a<strong> DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong> during the <strong>first round</strong> regardless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>is accepted by his or her <strong>kybuck</strong>, and the beast dashes through the jungle with no ill effect for the rest of the chase.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> (in other words, with a roll of <strong>15 or higher</strong>) also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on<strong> Animal Handling checks</strong> for the remainder of the chase sequence.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5</strong> can make a<strong> DC 10 Persuasion check</strong> as a <strong>free action </strong>to calm his or her <strong>kybuck</strong> for no ill effect. Failure means the hero has <strong>disadvantage </strong>on <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> made through the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the initial <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> has <strong>disadvantage</strong> on <strong>Animal Handling checks </strong>made through the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>scout trooper</strong> is almost completely out of <strong>Zone 1</strong> when the chase begins. During the <strong>first round</strong> of combat, the <strong>scout trooper</strong> is out of line of sight from the heroes. You (the GM) should roll <strong>Initiative </strong>for the <strong>scout trooper</strong> as normal, moving him from zone to zone just as the heroes move, though the scout technically begins the chase at the far end of <strong>Zone 1</strong>. As such, even though a hero might advance to the next zone before the <strong>scout trooper</strong> does, the scout will always be farther ahead of the heroes in the next zone when the heroes’ turn comes up. On subsequent <strong>rounds</strong>, the heroes might have a chance to draw closer to the <strong>scout trooper</strong> on his speeder bike. In any <strong>round</strong> in which the heroes manage to draw close enough to the scout to stop his progress (with a <strong>ranged attack</strong>, a <strong>Force power</strong>, or some other means), another<strong> scout trooper </strong>zooms ahead from a hidden post, moving into the next zone and out of line of sight immediately. This allows you to keep the chase going while letting the heroes gain experience points for defeating any <strong>scout troopers </strong>they manage to catch.</p>\n<p>After the <strong>first round</strong> of the chase sequence, all of the heroes who move their mounts into the jungle automatically advance to <strong>Zone 2</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Zone 2: The Fungal Swamp</h3>\n<p>The second zone of the chase is a massive fungal swamp. In this zone, shallow pools of water litter the landscape, and the <strong>kybucks</strong> send up huge splashes as their hoofed feet pass through the puddles. Large, multicolored fungi droop low over the landscape, and huge birds swoop down to scoop up prey. The fungal swamp is so thick that the heroes can hardly see in front of them; anything beyond <strong>100 feet</strong> is out of their line of sight. The <strong>kybucks </strong>have no difficulty navigating the swampy terrain, though the heroes should feel as though the jungle is closing in on them.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5</strong> manages to lead his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>out of the fungal swamp.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by<strong> 5 or more </strong>also moves within <strong>Long range</strong> of a <strong>blaster pistol</strong> (<strong>160 ft.</strong>) of the <strong>scout trooper</strong>. If the hero chooses a different path than the <strong>scout </strong>(see below), he remains within that range for <strong>Zone 4</strong> as well.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>can make a <strong>DC 10 Perception check</strong> as a <strong>free action</strong> to keep from getting lost in the thick undergrowth. Failure means the hero and his or her <strong>kybuck</strong> get lost in the fungal swamp and do not advance to the next zone of the chase on the next <strong>round</strong>. Although this does not have immediate consequences, it can prevent the hero from joining his comrades in the encounter at the end of the chase.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the initial <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> gets lost in the fungal swamp and does not advance, as described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each hero who advances through <strong>Zone 2 </strong>to the next zone of the chase must choose a path to follow. On each hero’s turn in this zone, describe two paths: one that appears to go through thick foliage, and another that travels through the hollowed-out trunk of a massive Felucian tree. Randomly determine which path the <strong>scout trooper</strong> takes with his speeder bike. Any heroes who choose the path through the foliage proceed to <strong>Zone 3A </strong>below. Any heroes who choose the path through the tree proceed to <strong>Zone 3B</strong> below. Both paths converge again in <strong>Zone 4</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Zone 3A: Hazardous Terrain</h3>\n<p>Any heroes who choose the path covered with thick overgrowth soon find themselves in treacherous terrain. This zone is filled with sinkholes and trenches, causing the <strong>kybucks </strong>to leap over the small gorges and chasms with bouncing grace. As the animals bound through this zone, the heroes dip and rise along with the terrain, making it difficult to see very far ahead.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> less than 5 </strong>manages to help direct his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>to the next zone without any difficulties.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> 5 or more </strong>also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>Animal Handling checks</strong> in the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> is moved down by <strong>2</strong> in the <strong>Initiative order </strong>for the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> </strong><strong>Animal Handling check</strong><strong> </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> is moved down by <strong>5</strong> in the <strong>Initiative order </strong>for the next <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each hero who advances to the next zone automatically advances to <strong>Zone 4</strong>. Any hero who managed to close with the <strong>scout trooper</strong> in the previous zone can make <strong>attacks </strong>or use <strong>Force powers</strong> against the scout in this <strong>round </strong>(but only if the scout followed this path, of course).</p>\n<h3>Zone 3B: Natural Tunnels</h3>\n<p>Heroes who choose the path through the hollowed-out tree find themselves traveling through a series of hollow logs and underground tunnels. The heroes and their mounts must lower their heads to prevent scraping the ceiling of these natural passageways. As the <strong>kybucks </strong>zip through the underground tunnels, chunks of moss and other fungi droop down from above, while breaks in the ceiling let occasional rays of light shine down on the heroes.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>progresses to the next zone without incident.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by<strong> 5 or more</strong> also closes further with the <strong>scout trooper</strong>, drawing within <strong>160 ft</strong>. (if the hero had not closed with the scout on previous <strong>rounds</strong>) or within <strong>40 ft. </strong>(if the hero had previously closed with the scout).</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> rides too close to a grasping set of roots that hang down into the tunnel, like tentacles. That hero must succeed on an opposed<strong> grapple check</strong> (versus the roots, which have a<strong> +2 bonus</strong>) to continue to the next zone. A failed <strong>check</strong> means that the hero and his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>becomes stuck in the natural tunnels, and on the following <strong>round </strong>the hero can take an action to disentangle from the roots.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong><strong> </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> runs into the hanging roots at full speed and is knocked off the <strong>kybuck</strong>. The animal stops and waits for the hero to mount up again the following <strong>round</strong>, but the hero is delayed in advancing until the following <strong>round</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any hero not snagged in the natural tunnels automatically advances to<strong> Zone 4</strong>. Any hero who managed to close with the <strong>scout trooper</strong> in the previous zone can make <strong>attacks </strong>or use <strong>Force powers </strong>against the scout in this <strong>round </strong>(but only if the scout followed this path, of course).</p>\n<h3>Zone 4: Awakening the Beast</h3>\n<p>When the heroes advance to Zone 4, they encounter a deadly specimen of Felucian fauna: a <strong>@Actor[nBEnHoSnp9X16zjq]{Rancor}</strong>. Fortunately, the creature is dying, and its death throes are all that it can bring to bear against the riders.</p>\n<p>When the first heroes move into this zone, the ground in front of them erupts. The <strong>rancor </strong>had buried itself under the dirt and undergrowth, and now it rises up and attempts to grab a hero and a <strong>kybuck </strong>as a last meal. The <strong>rancor </strong>is sluggish, but as it rises to its full height, pieces of debris and detritus fall off its body, creating a rain of soil and plants that spatters any heroes who race past.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5</strong> manages to lead his or her <strong>kybuck </strong>past the dying <strong>rancor </strong>without being slashed by its claws.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the<strong> Animal Handling check</strong> by<strong> 5 or more</strong> avoids any <strong>attack </strong>by the <strong>rancor </strong>and increases his or her <strong>Initiative by +2</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>. However, the <strong>attack </strong>is a glancing blow, dealing <strong>[[/r 1d6[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a success.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>. The creature makes a melee <strong>attack </strong>against the hero at a <strong>+8 bonus</strong>, dealing<strong>[[/r 2d6+5[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]</strong> <strong>damage </strong>on a success.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if a hero is <strong>attacked </strong>by the <strong>rancor</strong>, all heroes who make it through the zone advance to<strong> Zone 5</strong>, an Imperial outpost.</p>\n<h3>Zone 5: Valley Outpost</h3>\n<p>After encountering the <strong>rancor</strong>, the heroes leave the area of dense fungal growth and move into a clearing with a small river cutting through it. Though the river is shallow, it is relatively wide, and the <strong>kybucks </strong>splash through the river as it turns north toward a narrow valley. The <strong>scout trooper</strong> flies through this area just above the river, the speeder bike’s repulsors splitting the water and kicking up a wake. Several large, bulbous mushrooms rise out of the riverbank, creating large obstacles for anyone moving through the zone.</p>\n<p>On each hero’s turn, have that character make a <strong>DC 10 Animal Handling check</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>less than 5 </strong>advances to the combat encounter with no incidents and no special <strong>penalties </strong>or <strong>bonuses</strong>.</li>\n<li>Any hero who succeeds on the <strong>Animal Handling check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> also gains <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>attack </strong>rolls in the <strong>first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the<strong> Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>less than 5 </strong>suffers <strong>disadvantage </strong>on all<strong> saving throws</strong> in the<strong> first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n<li>Any hero who fails the <strong>Animal Handling check </strong>by <strong>5 or more</strong> gives their enemies <strong>advantage </strong>on <strong>attack</strong> rolls in the<strong> first round</strong> of combat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the heroes advance through <strong>Zone 5</strong>, they move into the encounter area, where combat takes place.

Cloaked in darkness and illuminated only by multicolored strobe lights, holoprojectors, and table lamps, the entire car pulses with a pounding beat. The younger guests (and the young at heart) come here to dance, carouse, and flirt—not necessarily in that order. Some notable guests present when the heroes arrive include <strong>Ardia Terrsyn,</strong> actress <strong>(major guest); Lynaa,</strong> famed fashion designer <strong>(major guest); Zalar Rishek,</strong> scion of the House of Rishek <strong>(major guest); Khyyynett, Brial Sullor,</strong> and <strong>Fia Nazhena.</strong></p>\n<p>The bouncer at the door refuses entry to the heroes (“<em><strong>You’re not on the list</strong></em>”) unless the guests have a group attitude of <strong>friendly</strong> or better, or at least one <strong>major guest</strong> has an <strong>attitude</strong> of <strong>friendly</strong> or better. However, the bouncer can be bribed (<strong>200 credits</strong>) with a <strong>DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. Offering <strong>ten times</strong> this amount grants <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The heroes need to make a memorable impression on these guests, being eye-catching, entertaining, and captivating even as they try not to look like they’re trying too hard. The heroes want to accumulate as many <strong>successes</strong> as possible, to a <strong>maximum</strong> of <strong>six.</strong> A little humiliation goes a long way, though: If the heroes accumulate a total of <strong>three failed activities</strong> over the <strong>encounter,</strong> their efforts begin to draw ridicule and scorn, effectively ending the challenge. (Heroes who want to participate in the auxiliary challenge, below, cannot participate in the <strong>primary challenge.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Served!</strong> Make a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Performance) check</strong>. If successful, your dance moves impress the crowd, outshining the competition. On a failure, you are outperformed by a rival, effectively closing off this approach. Because you need to show off new moves, add <strong>+2 </strong>to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt. Heroes can use the <strong>Help action</strong> to grant <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they are also proficient in <strong>Performance.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Pickup Artist:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. If successful, you attract the attention of a romantic prospect, making you the center of attention. On a failure, you are shot down in a particularly visible way, preventing further attempts. It’s difficult to attract multiple prospects in rapid succession, so add <strong>+2</strong> to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>Club Mix: </strong>You hit the audio booth and take a turn at mixing some tunes. Make a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> or <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. If successful, you mix a creative mash-up of different songs, drawing rousing approval from the crowd. On a failure, your attempt is halting, uneven, and embarrassing, preventing any future attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Break It Up! </strong>A scuffle breaks out near you between <strong>Zalar Rishek (major guest)</strong> and <strong>Khyyynett,</strong> with their respective entourages looking on. Make a <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. If successful, you convince the two calm down before the situation escalates. If you fail, the scuffle escalates into a brawl before the players eyes. Heroes can use the <strong>Help action</strong> to grant <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they are also proficient in <strong>Persuasion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> Though <strong>lumguzzling</strong> is mostly associated with Corellian spacers’ dives, the drinking contest has gained popularity (and notoriety) on the club scene and among idle rich who are “<strong>slumming.</strong>” In this challenge, one or more heroes go head to head with a rowdy bunch of drinkers, among them <strong>Lynaa</strong> (who, despite being twice the age of most in attendance, is quite gifted at the game). Whoever remains standing is the winner.</p>\n<p>Have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution saving throw</strong> when they first take a drink, on a successful <strong>save</strong> the player suffers no ill effects and continue to the next <strong>round.</strong> On a failed save the player is still standing but becomes intoxicated, gaining the <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.fGgXKHClM9aTq8t7]{Poisoned}</strong> condition. If they fail the <strong>save</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong>, they fall <strong>unconscious</strong> and fail the challenge. The <strong>DC </strong>of the <strong>Consitution</strong> save increases by <strong>1</strong> after every <strong>round.</strong></p>\n<p>If multiple heroes <strong>participate</strong> and last <strong>4 rounds</strong>, all receive <strong>full credit</strong> for beating the opposition, but the players can continue the contest for additional <strong>rounds</strong> for the sake of bragging rights.</p>\n<p>Though <em>lum</em> is a strong alcoholic beverage, its chemical structure breaks down exponentially faster as its concentration increases in an individual’s bloodstream, making it impossible to overdose on the drink. Because of this, any ill effects caused by <strong>lumguzzling</strong> is automatically removed if the hero rests for <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the end of the <strong>encounter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>If the heroes complete the primary challenge, they improve either <strong>group attitude</strong> or <strong>Ardia Terrsyn’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.</strong> If they broke up a fight, they also improve <strong>Zalar Rishek’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.</strong> If at least one hero completes the <strong>auxiliary challenge,</strong> he or she improves either <strong>group attitude</strong> or <strong>Lynaa’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.

Aden</strong> takes a shot at the heroes each <strong>round</strong>, even if it exposes him to their attacks.</p>\n<h4>Imperial Comm Operator</h4>\n<p>Each <strong>Imperial communications officer</strong> is a trained soldier first and foremost. Drawn from the ranks of the Imperial Army, these<strong> comm operators</strong> are capable of defending the<strong> prison facility</strong> as well as any other soldier. The operators are in charge of ensuring that communications continue to flow across <strong>Felucia </strong>and to the <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>in orbit, and all are entrusted with a higher level of security clearance, allowing them to convey secret messages to their superiors.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>This Imperial soldier wears a dark gray uniform and an Imperial Army helmet, and a blaster pistol is holstered at his hip.

{"_id":"STkMJygJi71IKB1v","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em> is the second adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e</strong></em> experience. This adventure lets the heroes delve deeper into the mysterious plot surrounding former Imperial <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, and the heroes should advance to<strong> 5th level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes get to see what the galaxy is like in the wake of the rise of the Empire, and they discover a bit more about the Empire’s secret plans and how they involve a Hutt crime lord named <strong>Darga</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>This adventure is designed under the assumption that you have run your heroes through the first <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> adventure, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>. The heroes should already be acquainted with <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Captain Sirona Okeefe</strong>, and <strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> of the Alderaanian starship <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. Beyond that, the heroes need to know only that there is much to be gained in working for <strong>Bail Organa</strong>, even indirectly, and that the Galactic Empire is up to something big.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t running <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, the heroes might be hired by an existing NPC in your campaign to investigate the dealings that a Hutt crime lord has with the Empire. They can try to discover what the Empire is trading with the Hutt and report back to their employer.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is highly recommended that you read the entire adventure thoroughly before running it. Some of the events can take place at varying times, and having full knowledge of the potential events can save you many headaches.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Summary</h4>\n<p>At a briefing aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> explains that part of his responsibility in a secret Imperial scheme known as the <strong>Sarlacc Project </strong>was to arrange the covert exchange of resources through a Hutt crime lord on the planet <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> orders the heroes to travel aboard <strong>Captain Okeefe’s </strong>transport to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, make contact with <strong>Darga</strong>, the Hutt gangster, and discover what he’s trading with the Empire.</p>\n<p>First, the heroes must find one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>underlings—a Devaronian named <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>—at a ruined warehouse. Though <strong>Raden </strong>does not wish to help them, the heroes must convince him to lead them to a hidden location in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>. The building is in fact <strong>Darga </strong>the Hutt’s <strong>palace</strong>, which the crime lord took over after its previous Neimoidian inhabitant (a high-ranking member of the Trade Federation) vanished, leaving it abandoned. The heroes enter the <strong>palace </strong>and are granted an audience with the Hutt. <strong>Darga </strong>has ordered them brought to him so that he can size them up, and he offers to let the heroes stay in his court for a few days, giving them a chance to impress him and gain his trust.</p>\n<p>The heroes stay in the <strong>palace’s</strong> <strong>guest quarters</strong>. During the final night of their stay, any <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive characters begin to hear whispers, as though someone were trying to communicate with them telepathically, and they feel a tugging in the <strong>Force</strong> toward one of the other rooms. Following the whispers, they discover a secret set of chambers below the guest quarters. Inside is a comatose woman, older and gray with weathered features, who is hooked up to machinery that is keeping her unconscious. Once the heroes revive her, they discover that she is a former Jedi Master named <strong>Denia </strong>who has been kept comatose ever since she fell in battle during the Clone Wars. Unfortunately, the heroes’ meddling hasn’t gone unnoticed, and <strong>Darga </strong>calls the<strong> palace guards</strong>, leaving the entire building in an uproar.</p>\n<p>As the heroes fight their way back to the upper levels of <strong>Darga’s palace</strong>, they quickly discover that the Hutt is living up to his species’ reputation for cowardice. Terrified at the prospect of having a Jedi loose in his <strong>palace</strong>, <strong>Darga</strong> flees to his space yacht and takes off for the planet <strong>Bespin</strong>. Though the Hutt leaves town in a hurry, his minions remain behind to try to finish off the intruders.</p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[LaGGHuPsaCPKi8uT]{Opening Crawl}</strong></p>","folder":"DUb0crJ7IJjaqUGJ","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The heroes may arrange themselves in any position they wish, but they should be close to the wall farthest from the other gladiators.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Just before the battle with <strong>Darga’s gladiators</strong> begins, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>High above the gladiator pit, Darga the Hutt presides over the beginning of the match, looking down on you with a slimy grin.

Riches and fame for all who are strong enough to seize them!” With that, the Hutt blows a massive horn that echoes throughout the open gladiator pit. Dirt crunches underfoot, and flickering light shines on you from the lamps mounted around the perimeter.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Gladiators</h4>\n<p><strong>Darga </strong>has a crop of interesting and dangerous gladiators, culled from the ranks of his previous teams and as eclectic as they come. The <strong>Karg brothers</strong> are three Gamorreans who may or may not really be brothers; no one has dared investigate the claim further. They specialize in melee combat, wielding extremely deadly <em>@Compendium[sw5e.vibroweapons.o8JR5oLCQOYpP9Oa]{Vibroaxes},</em> but they use <em>energy balls</em> as ranged weapons. The Rodian gladiator <strong>Zayda</strong> is an exile from his homeworld who tried his hand at bounty hunting before realizing that he just wanted to blast people for a living. His personal combat droid assistant, <strong>RX-7246,</strong> is a custom-made battle droid with an extensive library of heavy weapon combat routines. These five gladiators have already survived <strong>several rounds</strong> in the arena against other opponents and are eager to prove themselves against the heroes.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The five gladiators are an odd mix, making a team that seems as mismatched as it is diverse.

A sly-looking Rodian paces back and forth casually, gripping a blaster at his hip, clenching and unclenching his fist as he waits for the fight to start. A cobbled-together battle droid with three photoreceptors and a massive grenade launcher stands stock still, its only movement the occasional twitch of an electronic eye swiveling to examine you from a different angle.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>3 @Actor[moEVarSUbXL1kL2z]{Karg Brothers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[rZKkZVBNIjx0W66V]{RX-7246}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[odrt0PZl42HJ8g5B]{Zayda}</strong></p>\n<h4>Gladiator Tactics</h4>\n<p>The gladiators are willing to adhere to <strong>Darga’s </strong>decree that <em>stun weapons</em> be used in lieu of blaster bolts. The <strong>Karg Brothers</strong> are disappointed that they are not allowed to deal killing blows, and if they down a hero, they try to make sure he stays down if they can do so surreptitiously. <strong>RX-7246</strong> opens with <em>elctrostun grenades,</em> hoping to knock a hero or two down the condition track so that the Karg brothers can carve them up more easily. If at least two gladiators are knocked unconscious, or if all of the gladiators fall below half their <strong>hit points,</strong> they are angered and cast aside <strong>Darga’s </strong>decree, setting their weapons to fire normally. <strong>RX-7246</strong> switches to <em>@Compendium[sw5e.explosives.2FBYmG1YpbCujJG1]{Frag Grenades}</em> at this point, and <strong>Zayda</strong> retreats to make <strong>ranged attacks</strong>. The <strong>Karg brothers’</strong> tactics do not change.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note from the Foundry Conversion Team:</strong> In <em><strong>SW5E,</strong></em> there are no specific rules for stun settings on weapons. There doesn't need to be, as a character using an appropriate weapon can decide whether they did lethal or non-lethal damage when they drop a foe. What this means is that the moment where a character decides, mechanically, that they are using a 'stun setting' doesn't necessarily line up with the moment where the gladiators decide to stop using them inside the fictional framework of this fight. This is okay. You can describe the enemy switching off stun even though they aren't at the point of delivering a killing blow. While that might not have a mechanical effect, from a story standpoint, it clearly declares their intentions. If they are firing deadly blaster bolts in defiance of Darga's decree, it's obvious they've <em>already</em> decided the fate of any PC they reduce to zero HP.  While they technically make the decision when they drop their foe, there's no rule against making the call early and sticking to it.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If the heroes survive and win the match, they are congratulated by <strong>Darga</strong>, who also awards them <strong>1,000 credits’</strong> worth of jewels. Since the heroes have likely depleted many resources (including <strong>hit points),</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>agrees to end the session of his court for the day, allowing the heroes to retire to their rooms and recuperate.</p>\n<p>If the heroes lose the match, the Hutt bestows honors upon his gladiators and does not end the day’s session in court. If any hero decides to go to the guest chambers to recuperate, <strong>Darga </strong>continues on without him or her.

They usually work in pairs, though against particularly resilient foes, they will sometimes combine all of their fire against the same opponent. Additionally, since they wear modest armor, they will sometimes take more risks to close the <strong>range,</strong> forgoing <strong>cover</strong> if it means lining up a better shot.

As food and resources became increasingly scarce, his people turned on themselves in a series of increasingly vicious settlement wars. Though <strong>Vrakth</strong> originally began training as a soldier, he changed to follow the career of a scout. He learned the value of hunting prey with caution, but he also learned that most battles are won by those who shoot the fastest and can withstand the most damage. When a bounty hunter named <strong>Jeyrs Hundar</strong> followed a criminal to <strong>Vrakth’s</strong> homeland, the young Zabrak was one of only a handful of colonists still alive. Impressed with <strong>Vrakth’s</strong> tenacity and self-reliance, <strong>Hundar</strong> took him on as an apprentice bounty hunter.</p>\n<p><strong>Vrakth</strong> alternated between training to be a warrior and training to be a hunter, eventually becoming a crack shot with a pistol. He served as <strong>Hundar’s</strong> backup, covering escape routes and double-teaming the targets that were too dangerous to take solo. When <strong>Hundar</strong> proved too slow to bring in a particularly vicious Rodian, <strong>Vrakth</strong> completed the job. This established him as a feared bounty hunter. He soon came to the attention of a local Republic governor, who used him to hunt down CIS generals during the Clone Wars. <strong>Vrakth</strong> now works almost exclusively for the Empire, especially <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[PQpbByosyyjAGTSJ]{Vril Vrakth}</strong></p>\n<h4>Crab Droids</h4>\n<p><strong>Vrakth</strong> has <strong>six crab droids</strong> that he has modified to obey him and serve as his scouts and hunting drones. Each has an added <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.SRCb9q6OGdMs9iLG]{Commlink},</em> which allows him to give them override orders from his <strong>cloakshape fighter.</strong> The <strong>droids</strong> have been hunting and harassing the heroes throughout their time on <strong>Nizon,</strong> and if any remain, they are here. Since <strong>Vrakth</strong> is not directly controlling the <strong>crab droids,</strong> they attack the nearest foe who attacks <strong>Vrakth.</strong> Any hero who does not attack the bounty hunter is ignored by the <strong>crab droids.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Up to 6 @Actor[n98G5HxIjcyYiPhX]{LM-432 \"Muckraker\" Crab Droids}</strong></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[vH0L5dRT5wRAx4uR]{01 - Handout 1 - Crab Droid Checklist}</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>When the encounter has concluded, the heroes and their Nazren allies control the <strong>city,</strong> the <strong>rogue fragment tracking center,</strong> and the construction on <strong>Mount Antas.</strong> Any remaining Imperial forces evacuate or surrender, and reports begin to come in of <strong>Nazren</strong> seizing control in smaller outposts and settlements. Between the <strong>tracking center</strong> and the <strong>planetary shields</strong> and <strong>turbolasers</strong> (which they can complete), the <strong>Nazren</strong> can make retaking their planet too costly for the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Vrakth</strong> remains in contact with his apprentice, a Trandoshan bounty hunter named <strong>Koorst,</strong> who is flying in a <strong>cloakshape fighter</strong> with a hyperspace sled outside the range of the planet’s asteroid fragments and dust clouds. <strong>Koorst</strong> can’t fly safely to the surface now that the tracking station is in <strong>Nazren</strong> hands, but he receives constant reports from <strong>Vrakth</strong> during the rioting and even the final battle. If <strong>Vrakth</strong> is taken down, he drops an open <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.SRCb9q6OGdMs9iLG]{Commlink}</em> (unblocked by the <strong>Nazren</strong> in the control center) that shows <strong>Koorst</strong> yelling for more information. If the heroes pick up the <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.SRCb9q6OGdMs9iLG]{Commlink}</em> and <strong>Koorst</strong> sees any of their faces, he swears his eternal hatred of those who felled his mentor, then flies off into hyperspace. He will return in <em><strong>The Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>, later in the <em><strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong></em> campaign.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Point%20Gold.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong style=\"font-style:italic;text-align:center\">Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Vril Vrakth</strong> has a <strong>cloakshape fighter</strong> with an open cockpit docked on the southern edge of a construction platform. The fighter is <strong>datalocked</strong> and cannot be used in the battle; even a dedicated slicer would need too much time to crack it. However, in the cockpit is the control system with which <strong>Vrakth</strong> gives override orders to the <strong>crab droids.</strong> With a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>, a player could send an <strong>override</strong> command as an <strong>action,</strong> controlling a <strong>droid’s</strong> turn or resetting which targets it considers <strong>hostile,</strong> thus allowing it to make its own decisions.</p>\n<p>There is a <strong>framework</strong> all around the construction <strong>platform,</strong> which requires a<strong> DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check</strong> to move around in.

With its aid, I have deepened and lengthened my meditations and have begun to understand the glimpses I receive with greater accuracy. Unfortunately, the galaxy is filled with great suffering, and the cries of whole worlds oppressed come through the Force most clearly.</em></p>\n<p><em>“In particular, I have been hearing cries for help from what I believe to be the homeworld of the slaves you freed from the Imperials. Having seen and heard them more clearly, I now believe these prisoners were Nazren, a species from Centares, an obscure system in the Malrood Sector. I passed this information to Senator Organa, and he sent a few discreet inquiries to Aldera University.</em></p>\n<p><em>“It seems that the Nazren are a species from outside the Empire. They never joined the Republic and thus have no representation in the Senate. The Empire has a small force on the mining planet Centares, the third world in the Centares System, but has been reassigning those ships for some weeks. The Nazren are native to Nizon, the fifth planet in the system. Since the Empire has no official interest in Nizon, it seems likely that they have made raids on Nizon for slave labor, perhaps originally to run the mines on Centares. But they might have left some records or clues on Nizon about the Sarlacc Project. Also, the people of Nizon might make useful allies if the Empire has mistreated them.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Though there is little information about Centares or Nizon in our records, Captain Verana has managed to locate hyperspace coordinates for Nizon in his navcomputer. He’s willing to share them with you—if you’re willing to travel there. I ask that you take a trip to Nizon and investigate its treatment at the hands of the Empire. Proof of Imperial depredations might give Senator Organa additional influence in the Senate, and if the Nizon are interested in opposing the Empire on a widespread basis, we might be able to assist them.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After speaking to <strong>Denia,</strong> the heroes are likely to have numerous questions. <strong>Denia</strong> admits that she has few hard facts, but her sense through the <strong>Force</strong> is that the <strong>Nazren</strong> are suffering in a way that could be stopped, and that the heroes will find something worth their time. Here are some possible answers to questions that the heroes might ask.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why don’t you go yourself, or at least come with us?</strong> “<em>Though this is one of the strongest visions I have had in my meditations, it is far from the only tremor I have sensed in the Force. I need to remain here for some weeks yet to meditate on these feelings and try to clarify them. Unfortunately, I feel that the threat—and the opportunity—on Nizon cannot wait for me to be ready. That’s why I ask you, my trusted friends.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What is Centares or Nizon like?</strong> “<em>We don’t have much information about them. Both are apparently very dusty planets, and I can provide breath masks for any of you that don’t already have them. There is a single mining operation on Centares, with no native life, and one major city on Nazren. That’s all we know.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What kind of opposition are we likely to face?</strong> “<em>The Empire has been removing its forces from Centares for some time; that much is clear through reports filed with the Senate. It has no official presence on Nizon, but I sense that some threat does lurk there. I can’t give you more advice than this: Be cautious, and don’t grow overconfident.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s in it for us?</strong> Hopefully, by now you know your players well enough to know if they need more incentives than an opportunity for adventure and a chance to oppose the Empire. If they do need a financial motive, <strong>Denia</strong> provides one: “<em>Senator Organa is willing to pay each of you 4,000 credits just for making the trip. If you find the information that I sense waits there, he will reward you for recovering that as well.</em>”</li>\n</ul>","folder":"rBRBpAag1mn1GfSw","sort":-25000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"VEYeW2ytdJVaeV0t","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>The Gem of Alderaan</strong></em> is the eighth adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e</strong></em> experience. This adventure begins the third act of the campaign, which consists of three adventures: <em><strong>The Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>, <em><strong>Sword of the Empire</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Jaws of the Sarlacc</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>About <strong>six months</strong> have passed since the last adventure. Over the course of this adventure, the heroes will infiltrate a high society gala, play high-stakes games of <strong>sabacc</strong>, and fight alongside Imperial <strong>stormtroopers</strong> to defend against hijackers bent on capturing a train full of dignitaries. The heroes should start <em><strong>The Gem of Alderaan</strong></em> at <strong>15th level</strong> and reach <strong>17th level</strong> by the conclusion. With some modifications, this adventure can also be used as a stand-alone scenario or as part of your existing campaign.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Update</h2>\n<p><strong>Six months</strong> pass from the end of <em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em> to the beginning of the final story arc of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. During this time, <strong>Bail Organa </strong>keeps the heroes safe from scrutiny while they continue to search for <strong>Master Denia</strong>. Following the destruction of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, both <strong>Master Denia</strong> and <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> vanished without a trace and have not been seen or heard from since.</p>\n<p><strong>Bail Organa</strong> walks a fine line in the Imperial Senate. <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>— whose true allegiance was revealed at the end of the last adventure— knows that <strong>Organa</strong> has been engaging in seditious actions, but he cannot bring the Senator to trial without revealing the existence of the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> which he is loath to do.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the heroes are now considered enemies of the Empire. They have death marks on their heads, and only <strong>Senator Organa’s</strong> protection keeps them from being captured or killed by bounty hunters and Imperial agents. The need to keep a low profile complicates their task of finding <strong>Denia</strong> and the prototype <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>.</p>\n<p>If desired, you can use this gap to run your own adventures as the heroes follow leads and avoid the authorities, helping the PCs achieve <strong>15th level</strong> before starting <em><strong>The Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>. The heroes might learn about their death marks the hard way after encountering determined bounty hunters. They might fight their way out of trouble, alter their wanted postings to include faulty information (such as “<em><strong>Last seen on Bespin</strong></em>”), or get their postings moved down the priority list (perhaps by faking the appearance of an even more notorious criminal). They might accomplish this by slicing into computer systems, planting rumors, or gaining the assistance of a crime lord or corrupt law enforcement officer.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>After <strong>months</strong> of searching, <strong>Bail Organa</strong> finally learns that the Empire has taken <strong>Jedi Master Denia</strong> to the planet <strong>Prakith</strong> in the <strong>Deep Core,</strong> a fortress world that serves as the base of operations for the <strong>Inquisitorius.</strong> It is virtually impossible to travel to <strong>Praxis</strong> without Imperial security clearance, and the background check necessary to obtain clearance would reveal that the heroes have death marks on their heads.</p>\n<p>However, <strong>Senator Organa </strong>has discovered that <strong>Lady Alya Aldrete</strong>—an Alderaanian heiress known for her decadent behavior—has access to security clearances, using them so smugglers in her employ can ferry forbidden goods to and from the heavily secured <strong>Deep Core</strong> worlds. To have a chance to speak with her, the heroes must attend the maiden voyage of the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>, a luxury repulsortrain that is a part of her family’s collection of resorts, casinos, and passenger liners.</p>\n<p>When the PCs arrive at the launch station, <strong>stormtroopers</strong> line the perimeter as Imperial officers mill about with the Alderaanian nobles. The maiden voyage will last <strong>several hours</strong>, during which time the heroes must make a good impression through a series of social encounters: playing <strong>sabacc </strong>in the casino, rubbing shoulders with nobles at a fancy dinner, holding intelligent conversation in the lounge, and even engaging in recreation in the onboard nightclub.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the heroes gain the notice of <strong>Lady Aldrete’s</strong> personal assistant, a Twi’lek named <strong>Notru’denn</strong>, who summons them to her private traincar. He reveals that his employer’s appearance as a self-centered noble is just a cover for her clandestine activities. In truth, <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> uses her <strong>Deep Core</strong> smugglers as spies, creating an information network that spans the galaxy. If the heroes convince <strong>Notru’denn</strong> of their sincerity, he offers to arrange an audience with <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> as soon as she returns.</p>\n<p>Moments later, the repulsortrain lurches and alarms sound. Trandoshan mercenaries hijack the train, hold the passengers hostage in the control car, and will release them only if <strong>Senator Organa</strong> surrenders. (They saw <strong>Organa</strong> on the guest list and think that the <strong>Senator</strong> is on board.) The heroes fight the first group of mercenaries in a dark nightclub, using their wits to overcome their relative lack of weapons. Pushing into the casino car, they find an Imperial dignitary and his <strong>stormtroopers</strong> fighting more mercenaries and a heavily armed war droid. Working with their unlikely allies, the heroes storm the dining car (filled with hostages) to rescue the last large cluster of guests onboard.</p>\n<p>When the heroes move forward through the observation car, they are attacked by the mercenaries’ starfighters, which seem intent on destroying the car. The heroes uncouple the trailing cars to protect the civilians on board, then fight the starfighters, outgunned by their powerful weapons.</p>\n<p>When the heroes finally reach the control car, they find the Trandoshan mercenary commander using <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> as a human shield. He drags her up to the roof, where the final showdown takes place as the out-of-control repulsortrain speeds hundreds of meters above a snowcovered mountain range. After the heroes defeat the Trandoshan and rescue <strong>Lady Aldrete, Captain Sirona Okeefe’s </strong>transport swoops down to scoop them up as the train careens into the mountains below. They blast their way past the mercenary transport and return to <strong>Senator Organa</strong> to negotiate with <strong>Lady Aldrete,</strong> moving one step closer to saving <strong>Master Denia</strong> and stopping the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Foundry Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> This is a good time to point out how the <strong>milestones</strong> land throughout the final adventures in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong>. The ninth adventure ends with the characters reaching <strong>19th level</strong>. The final adventure has no level-up milestones. This doesn't appear to be an error. If one looks back to the original adventures, there wasn't enough xp awarded by the last adventure to make it likely for the party to reach <strong>20th level </strong>before the end of the adventure. Since many will see this as a good place to end the story, players might find it somewhat <em>less</em> than satisfying to have their characters reach <strong>20th level </strong>at the very end (presumably), but never actually play them with their final builds and capstone abilities. Because of this, if a gamemaster intends to end their campaign with <em><strong>Jaws of the Sarlacc</strong></em>, they might want to be aware of this, and perhaps shorten the placement of the <em><strong>milestones</strong></em> throughout act three by an ennounter or two each so that the heroes achieve <strong>level 20</strong> earlier. Maybe even by the begining of episode 10. This might require a little difficulty adjustment for that final outing, but it would be much more satisfying.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>If you wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[IZoKqwLdYxDP9LZc]{Opening Crawl}</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"2thVWOSc0Xr3eK8T","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

There are four guard towers, one at each corner of the yard, with two heavily armed stormtroopers in each. Two vicious, cybernetically enhanced Nek dogs patrol the inside of the yard, growling at the prisoners without getting too close to them.

Most of the <strong>Nazren</strong> throw themselves prone when any fighting starts (so as not to get in <strong>Sartok’s</strong> way) and are ignored by the <strong>stormtroopers.</strong> This also prevents the tower <strong>guards</strong> from going after the heroes immediately, as they must continue to watch the prisoners.</p>\n<p>The <strong>stormtroopers</strong> who are free to engage the heroes move onto the stone wall around the yard to get closer to any heroes shooting or escaping.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Nek</strong> battle <strong>dogs</strong> <strong>attack</strong> heroes who have <strong>melee</strong> weapons over those who have <strong>ranged</strong> weapons.

It takes the reinforcements <strong>5 minutes</strong> to muster and reach the detention camp.

But when <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> tracked his lost <strong>greethka</strong> to the debris cavern, he found that the creature had gorged on Imperial trash to the point where it had become wild and unruly to manage.</p>\n<p>Leading the heroes through smooth-surfaced tunnels populated by surprised Stereb stoneworkers, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> explains that he had worked his way alone upstream, hoping to find where the trash was coming from, when he was captured by Imperial workers sealing off that entrance to the cavern. Unrestrained, the <strong>greethka</strong> gorged on everything the Imperials could throw away. By removing the still-living nucleus from the slain <strong>greethka,</strong> the heroes will permit <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> to raise a proper-sized creature again, thus saving his livelihood. Either way, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> owes his life to the heroes, and the Stereb civilians now gawking at the strange visitors take the long-missing herder’s presence as an endorsement of the newcomers.</p>\n<h2>The Nerve Center</h2>\n<p><strong>Herdr’tui</strong> leads the heroes into an underground grotto. Luminescent stalagmites hang from the ceiling, dripping a greenish dew and providing light for the room. This is clearly an important area to the Stereb culture—the nerve center of this community (in more ways than one, as the heroes will see). There are eight tunnels leading into the Grotto and eight rubble piles in the center of the room. Each 5 feet high, the rubble piles include pebbles and larger fist-sized rocks.</p>\n<p><strong>Herdr’tui</strong> calls out into the emptiness, and, moments later, eight withered and shrunken Stereb enter, one through each of the eight entrances. That includes the entrance <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> led the heroes through; the heroes are not entirely sure how or when that particular elder female Stereb entered the tunnel behind them. <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> nods graciously to that figure, indicating his fealty to her. The aged Stereb settle atop the eight rubble piles as if they were sitting on beanbags. The piles are horribly uncomfortable for anyone else, but the Stereb seem to find this kind of furniture completely acceptable.</p>\n<p><strong>Herdr’tui</strong> stands before his leader, whose name is <strong>Eldr’har,</strong> and recounts recent events in the Stereb language. The exposition is drawn out and ponderous; there’s no use for speedy storytelling when you’re a Stereb with all the time in the world and no place to go. <strong>Eldr’har</strong> acts as if she’s already aware of the information somehow and addresses the heroes in broken Basic:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:28.4286px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:28.4286px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:28.4286px\">\n<p><em>“You are not a part of us. Yet you have brought a part of us back to us. You are not harmful to Prakith—you have helped Prakith. There is so much illness to Prakith—we are beset with it. We hope you have come to this place to help Prakith further.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Eldr’har</strong> speaks solemnly, always using plural pronouns; while Stereb are individuals with specialized tasks, they don’t seem to have particularly strong egos. <strong>Eldr’har</strong> invites questions from the heroes. Below are answers to some questions they might ask:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who are the Stereb? </strong>“<em>We are of the stone. We belong to Prakith, its walls, and its vessels.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Have the Stereb always been here? </strong>“<em>That’s a strange question. Where else would we be?</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are you connected to the Stereb on other planets?</strong> “<em>Other planets? There are other planets? Prakith is all!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are you in charge here?</strong> “<em>All here serve Prakith. We all have our function. We elders know the function best.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How is Stereb society constructed?</strong> “<em>We all have our function. The Herders, like Herdr’tui, clear debris. The Hewers work the passages, keeping them open. The Feeders tend to us all. All of us are important to Prakith.</em><strong>”</strong></li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the Imperial presence above?</strong> “<em>All that is of Prakith, belongs. That which is outside is not a part of us.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the mining activity?</strong> “<em>There is a cancer on Prakith. We were created to protect against it. But the cancer moves too fast. We can but slow its progress.</em>”</li>\n<li> <strong>Do you know a way into the Citadel?</strong> “<em>We do not know what you are talking about.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Heroes who succeed on <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (Lore) check</strong> recognize that the Stereb are not local, but part of a race that has been encountered on other worlds previously. If the players roll <strong>above a 25</strong>, they additionally recall specific details of their presence elsewhere: While the Stereb have lived on the surface of rocky planets, erecting stone buildings and monuments, their true presence is underground, in the great catacombs they have hewn. It is impossible to divine the original Stereb homeworld; they do not seem to know, themselves.</p>\n<p>Understanding the true nature of Stereb society requires a multidisciplinary approach and almost certainly requires the pooling of the heroes’ skills. A<strong> successful DC 20 Intelligence check</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> as players pool their knowledge reveals that the Stereb consider the world they are on to be a living entity (even though, in truth, it is not). The Stereb believe that they are literally the planet’s <strong>antibodies:</strong> microorganisms living symbiotically with the rocky world, responsible for its care. That extends to clearing tunnel blockages to improve the planet’s <strong>“circulation”</strong> of air and water, keeping the effects of erosion uniform, and above all, <strong>respecting the surface environment</strong>, which seems to be the source of the <strong>“illness” Eldr’har</strong> describes. Stereb society breaks down into roughly <strong>eight different sectors</strong>, all corresponding to various imagined autonomic systems within <strong>Prakith’s</strong> planet-sized <strong>“anatomy.” Herders,</strong> such as <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> direct their creatures to clear away foreign matter from the planet’s tunnels; <strong>Hewers</strong> keep the tunnels safe and clear; <strong>Feeders</strong> harvest the lichens to sustain the Stereb.</p>\n<p>Any attempt to disabuse <strong>Eldr’har</strong> or the other Stereb of the notion that <strong>Prakith</strong> is a living entity, or that they are part of the planetary <strong>immune</strong> system, results in reduced cooperation, but only by a matter of degree. The Stereb are generally compliant and slow to anger, reacting only in response to an immediate threat. Words do not offend them.</p>\n<h2>Excising a Tumor</h2>\n<p>The Stereb seem eager (eager for them, anyway) to entertain their visitors. It isn’t something they get to do very often. This is a good time for the heroes to rest and recuperate, although the toasted fungus the Stereb serve might not sit well with many stomachs.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldr’nol,</strong> the youngest male of the elder eight, takes a particular interest in the newcomers. <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> and his followers are responsible for the logistical needs of the tribe: keeping tabs on where the tunnelers need to go, what the lichen harvesters are doing, and—importantly for the heroes—the big picture of the surface and underworld. <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> proudly demonstrates a huge slab painted with many phosphorescent hues, which represents the Stereb map of their world as they know it. This is the petrigram, “<em><strong>the Worldflesh set in stone.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Eldr’nol</strong> does not recognize references to the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius, Prak City,</strong> or anywhere else aboveground unless the heroes provide some kind of geographic context. Human structures are basically all alike to the Stereb, but they do know what the <strong>Prak City</strong> plateau above them looks like, as well as the <strong>Magraddor Range,</strong> the mountainous area where the <strong>Citadel</strong> is. (Granted, the Stereb mostly know it from below, but enough of their kind have reached the surface for mappers to recognize its terrain.) With patience, the heroes can piece together where they are in relationship to the Stereb map and where the surface features are.</p>\n<p>The <strong>cavern system</strong> near <strong>Prak City</strong> goes much farther than the Empire’s records or mining surveys suggest. The <strong>Prakithian</strong> crust includes large swaths of minerals that make sonic and gravitic surveys of cave systems unreliable. (Many of those same minerals are what make the planet so attractive to miners.) Importantly, the petrigram depicts a second extensive cave system to the west, near the <strong>Geddis</strong> mining operation seen from orbit. Other veins stretch even farther <strong>west</strong> from that, tantalizingly close to the <strong>Magraddor Range</strong>—and the <strong>Citadel</strong>—more than a <strong>hundred kilometers </strong>away. That portion of the petrigram is dusty and worn, as if it has not been referred to or updated in many <strong>years.</strong></p>\n<p>The closest approach of the <strong>Prak City</strong> Stereb Network (as the heroes might well call it) to the <strong>Geddis</strong> cave system is only a <strong>day’s</strong> spelunk away, but it might as well be light years. As <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> explains, the Stereb themselves closed the only connecting passage:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“Sister Eldr’har spoke true. A cancer has come to our Prakith. On the flesh, as with those who took our herder son, and in the flesh, as well. What you see inscribed in stone is the record of a desperate act, but an act of love, to save Prakith.</em></p>\n<p><em>“When the parasites first arrived, we did not know what they were. We hoped they were like us—the Stereb, the greethka, all of us who are part of the whole. But when they took to burrowing, we found they were of another.

Hundreds of Stereb were at work in what you call the Geddis caves, tending Prakith as is our purpose. The parasites took our cousins and turned them against that purpose, forcing them to join in ravaging our planet’s hide. They became part of the cancer, and we had no choice but to amputate.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It should be apparent from <strong>Eldr’nol’s</strong> speech and the petrigram that the Stereb are referring to miners who entered the caverns and enslaved the inhabitants, forcing the rest of the Stereb to collapse the only connecting tunnel.</p>\n<p>The Stereb elders must be persuaded that the <strong>Geddis</strong> Stereb can be restored to their society because their behavior has been only temporarily changed by their new masters. This is a <strong>DC 30 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong> because the heroes are up against what is an article of faith for the Stereb—that their enslaved cousins have been turned into parasites ravaging the planet. Players who learned about the culture of the Strereb have <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check.</strong> Additionally, if the heroes recognized the importance of the <strong>greethka</strong> nucleus to <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> and rose above their disgust to retrieve it, the herder Stereb now relates that story to the elders in their own language, lowering the <strong>DC</strong> to <strong>25</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes succeed in persuading the elders, a workforce of <strong>20</strong> able-bodied Stereb escorts them the <strong>day’s</strong> walk to the westernmost terminus, where an engineered cave-in prevents access to the labyrinth under the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine. Working faster than the heroes might imagine anyone could manage with primitive tools, the Stereb clear a Humansized passage through the blockage. However, they will not follow the heroes into the unknown. The Stereb will follow only after the heroes inform them that the areas ahead have been secured. They are workers, not warriors.</p>\n<p>If the heroes fail to persuade the Stereb to lead them to the cave-in, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> encourages them to go it alone, using the directions they have already gleaned from the petrigram. This lengthens the trip to <strong>five days</strong>, since the heroes do not have the Sterebs’ skill at tunneling under challenging conditions. But the Stereb admire their devotion to the task, which is a matter of great merit in their society.</p>\n<h2>The Exclave</h2>\n<p>When the heroes break through the collapsed rubble separating the two Stereb labyrinths, read the following description aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>There is a rush of air, and you are surprised by its foulness. The Stereb labyrinth behind you had been musty, but fresh air still flowed, perhaps due in some way to the glowing lichens. Here, there is nothing but the stench of bodies living in cramped quarters with no hope of escape. A light shines up ahead, but whatever lives here must not have much of a life.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Heroes enter an octagonal room currently serving as the Stereb slave quarters. If the players were not particularly stealthy, they provoke a panicked response from one of the Stereb occupants, attracting the attention of the <strong>guards</strong> in nearby command post to the west. These <strong>guards</strong> however while willing to do anything for a paycheck are of little threat to the players and should not be treated as such, they'll fold to most arguments or threats as the players look almost exactly like the bounties placed on people who killed <strong>Imperial Guard Champions</strong> and <strong>Inquisitors.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players prefer to be stealthy, they attract the attention of a teenage Stereb girl, <strong>Helr’ven.</strong> She is serving as a nurse for the <strong>eight Stereb</strong> under her care in the slave quarters. All of them are in pretty bad shape from overwork and mining-related injuries, and she’s taken this duty because everyone older is gone.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>months</strong> since the Stereb blocked the passage, <strong>Helr’ven</strong> has not seen anyone enter from that direction. Her spirits, raised by the thought that her people have returned, fall immediately when she sees the heroes, whom she assumes must be more miners. Since the other Stereb won’t have followed the heroes in, <strong>Helr’ven</strong> begins the meeting with an attitude of <strong>unfriendly.</strong> The heroes must quietly move her to being friendly with them, a <strong>DC 23 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, convincing her that they are not miners who have wiped out the Stereb on the other side of the divide. If she can’t be convinced, she raises an alarm that brings in the <strong>guards</strong> as mentioned above. However she will come around as the <strong>guards</strong> are unlikely to acknowledge the players and scuttle off to get significantly stronger forces to deal with them.</p>\n<p>If convinced, <strong>Helr’ven</strong> grows tearfully happy and becomes a useful source of information, responding to questions quietly so as not to alert those to the west:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How many are you? </strong>“<em>Eight left. There were fourteen working the mine but they died earlier today. We are so few now.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Who is holding you?</strong> “<em>The foreign bodies—those like you—hold us with their lightmakers and sound-makers. They destroy, destroy, nothing but destroy.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How many are they?</strong> “<em>Two just outside, I think. They come and go. They have made their station in the chamber beyond, where they send our workers out from.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How many access points are there to the surface?</strong> “<em>I don’t know anything about that, but the foreigners arrived by breaking through one of our tunnels and have since added three more.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How strong are they? </strong>“<em>Very strong. Stronger than us. They even have things seemingly made of rock that spit fire. And they have brought pestilence, large and small.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Can we expect help from your people?</strong> “<em>We are few, and so sick. They work us until we die. But we are with you in spirit.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Do you know how to reach the Citadel in the Magraddor Range?</strong> “<em>I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re talking about.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Helr’ven</strong> urges the heroes to take the sickly Stereb back through the eastern passage. This is a fairly complicated enterprise and requires a <strong>DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>, representing the players removing a Stereb, a failed <strong>check</strong> gains the attention of the guards. <strong>Helr’ven</strong> will not leave her patients and will follow them where they go.</p>\n<h2>A Path to the Past</h2>\n<p>Once the miners have been incapacitated or driven out of the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine and the elevator disabled, a happy and tearful reunion occurs between the two Stereb colonies. The <strong>Prak City</strong> Stereb widen the passageway and tend to their ailing cousins.</p>\n<p>Now far more receptive to the heroes’ interests, the Stereb offer to share all they know about the caverns between here and the <strong>Magraddor Range,</strong> where the <strong>Citadel</strong> stands. Consulting first with a haggard survivor from the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine, <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> joins the heroes in the chamber that was the miners’ command station—a gallery of sorts, with pictograms on the walls. Removing a particular stone from the south side of the western wall, <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> opens a secret passage <strong>15 feet wide</strong> leading off to the <strong>west.</strong> The control for the <strong>secret door</strong> is well hidden—the miners never found it—and heroes on their own would have to make a <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> to find it. Inside the hidden chamber, <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> shows the heroes another petrigram map. A long, narrow Stereb passage leads to a network that extends close to the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> Eldr’nol speaks:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“You are not of Prakith, but your actions show that you are truly born anew of Prakith. Know, then, the secret kept here.

This tunnel leads to a large system where, in ancient times, our forefolk worked far and wide, and even to the mountains you ask of.</em></p>\n<p><em>“The way is far—many, many days’ walk—and you will find, as they did, that the waters have overtaken much of the way. Death for Stereb lies that way. I cannot know if this affects such as you, but if the peaks are your destination, you will find that we have already worked the roots.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A relatively easy <strong>DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check </strong>enables the heroes to evaluate the western tunnel in relation to the petrigram and realize that more than <strong>60 miles</strong> of tunnels separate them from the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> With relation to other surface features, it neatly splits the area between the <strong>Geddis</strong> mining operation and the <strong>Rilkean</strong> mines, farther to the <strong>southwest.</strong> The heroes also realize that the tunnel leading ahead is wide enough to allow the passage of a single <strong>speeder bike</strong> which the hired miners <strong>often leave around speeder bikes</strong> while mining.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldr’nol’s</strong> knowledge comes in handy during questioning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are the tunnels all as wide as this one?</strong> “<em>If they remain open, yes. Sometimes they are wider—much wider. The Stereb lived there for a long time and expended great efforts to perfect Prakith’s flesh. Some are long and narrow, but none should be impassible.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What did you mean when you said the waters had taken over?</strong> “<em>The tale is a sad one. Prakith wept, and the tears came down from the mountains and through our passages. Prakith did not favor the work of the Stereb there, and much of our network collapsed into an underground sea. Many Stereb were swallowed in the cataclysm. Since, we have worked to do better by Prakith.</em><strong>”</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Are the tunnels completely flooded?</strong> “<em>I have not visited the place since as a boy, when the waters crested a Stereb’s height. But we know nothing of travel and water—in, under, or above it. I would fear to go.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are there exits from the tunnels? Do the tunnels reach the part of the range where the Citadel rises? </strong>“<em>I do not know this Citadel, but the Stereb of old often dug pores to the surface within mountains to vent Prakith’s fevers and provide air for our workers. Could any be there, so far away? None can know.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The heroes should realize that they’re on their own in any underground assault through the abandoned <strong>Magraddor</strong> tunnels, and that the <strong>speeder bikes</strong> represent the way there and across any water barrier in something less than an eternity. It seems foolish to assault the <strong>Citadel</strong> aboveground, where the skies and surface are strictly monitored and <strong>Inquisitors</strong> can sense <strong>Force-users</strong> for <strong>kilometers</strong> around. Underground, however, the heroes might have a chance.</p>\n<p><strong>Eldr’nol</strong> is sad to see the heroes go, but hopeful that they will find what they’re seeking. He encourages them to make their own copy of the petrigram so they won’t get lost.</p>\n<p>The Stereb provide what meager provisions they can for your journey as you prepare to leave. Although <strong>Eldr’nol’s</strong> imagination has clearly been captured by your expedition, he can only stand by sadly and wave to his new friends. It is not for the Stereb to have adventures. Others might think of the stars, but the Stereb serve the world.</p>\n<h2>The Underground Sea</h2>\n<p>The journey to the <strong>Underground Sea</strong> is a long one—more than <strong>60 miles</strong> to the point where the flooded chambers start. The passage is a mixture of Stereb stonework and natural caverns, containing a lot of sharp turns and abrupt changes in elevation. The tunnels have not been occupied in <strong>years,</strong> so although some glowing lichen grows naturally in spots, no attempt has been made to cultivate it at regular intervals. It’s pretty much headlights or nothing.</p>\n<p>The trip takes <strong>two and a half hours</strong> assuming they have <strong>speeder bikes</strong> or <strong>twenty hours </strong>if they are simply walking. If they are on <strong>speeder bikes</strong> have them make a<strong> DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the start of their journey to keep track of any dangerous walls or stalactites. If they fail the <strong>check,</strong> an obstacle in their way at some point during the ride causes an accident, dealing <strong>99 ([[/r 18d10[kinetic] # Kinetic damage]]) damage</strong> from the collision or accident. It is assumed that players walking there are not going fast enough to have an issue.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes enter the <strong>Underground Sea</strong> area, they might not realize immediately that they’ve arrived. Puddles appear below, separated by higher ground. Ankle-deep water stands in another several <strong>kilometers</strong> of hallways. Then it grows darker as the sparse lichen on the walls disappears, and soon the walls and the ground disappear, as well. Read the following description aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>There were walls here, once, and floors. But it’s all gone now, collapsed under the weight of the floodwaters. Who knows how many Stereb chambers stood here? Now, the sea below has claimed them all, and the water is too close for comfort because the surface above remains, its irregular shape hanging like a curtain to catch speeders who come too close.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With the tunnel widening out, the heroes must specify their riding order in two dimensions, since there is no room for two bikes to stack vertically in this cramped area where the water table is so close to the surface above. Ahead is darkness and fear, as is proven when the heroes enter a bottleneck area; see the encounter “<strong>Underground Sea</strong>” for more information.</p>\n<h2>Stairway to Hell</h2>\n<p>Escaping the <strong>fear moss,</strong> the heroes advance to the far northern end of the <strong>Underground Sea.</strong> True to <strong>Eldr’nol’s</strong> speculation, the Stereb tunnels begin to reappear, first as fixtures rising from the water, and finally as passageways leading from the destroyed underwater section. Once in the dry tunnels, the heroes find that the stonework is much more detailed than what they saw in the other Stereb tunnels. This was one of their ancient haunts, and clearly an important one.</p>\n<p><strong>Twenty miles</strong> of tunnels lie ahead, and after the first <strong>10</strong>, no further travel by <strong>speeder bike</strong> is possible. For the first time, the heroes encounter stairs, which lead up through an angling, turning passageway that no bike can navigate. Even minor <strong>Force sensitivity</strong> is enough to reveal that the passageway leads not upward to the light, but to someplace very <strong>dark:</strong> an approach to the base of the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius,</strong> nestled in the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> The <strong>fear moss</strong> was attracted to the <strong>Underground Sea</strong> by the <strong>Citadel’s</strong> presence, feeding off the <strong>dark side</strong> energy. But at the same time, the <strong>moss</strong> cloaks the heroes’ approach. It’s a security flaw the <strong>Citadel</strong> certainly would do something about—that is, if the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> had any notion of the extent of the tunnels under the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong></p>\n<p>As the heroes climb higher and higher through the dark staircases, it becomes increasingly important for <strong>Force-users</strong> to shield their thoughts. <strong>Three kilometer-long</strong> underground staircases stand between the heroes and a Stereb-constructed stone <strong>“pore,”</strong> not far from the foundation of the towering black spire of the <strong>Citadel,</strong> but reaching the <strong>pore</strong> undetected will be challenging. At the beginning of each staircase, <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> PCs must make a <strong>Wisdom</strong> or <strong>Charisma check</strong> to avoid being detected by an Imperial <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> adding proficiency if they are proficient in the <strong>Deception</strong> skill. <strong>DC 20</strong> for the first staircase, <strong>DC 25</strong> for the second, and <strong>DC 30 </strong>for the third. The increasing difficulty reflects the heroes’ proximity to the <strong>Citadel</strong> and their distance from the underground field of <strong>fear moss.</strong> A failed <strong>check</strong> results in a welcoming party appearing when the heroes emerge—an early activation of the <strong>“@JournalEntry[Tk7T1AHpIdpbdKCF]{Citadel Security Team}”</strong> encounter, listed in <strong>@JournalEntry[ZUdjErWvapAzVLk7]{Part 3}</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Note: </strong>This should be considered a level up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"8VGe7GmKnpKSTMzY","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Drawn from the best private security forces in the galaxy, all <strong>Wing Guard</strong> <strong>security chiefs</strong> are guaranteed to make their squads better, more accurate, and more perceptive.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This member of Bespin’s Wing Guard boasts rank insignia far more impressive than that of the other members of the security team.

From that point on, he seeks shelter behind the crates on the landing pad. If he sees that the fight is going against his men, he summons the two <strong>security guards</strong> from the lowest level (they call the <strong>turbolift</strong> on <strong>one round</strong> and ride it up the next), and then locks down the <strong>turbolift</strong> so that no one else can access it.</p>\n<p>He is carrying <strong>500 credits.</strong></p>\n<h4>Cloud City Patrol Droid</h4>\n<p>These droid security assistants are left over from the Clone Wars and have been modified to aid the <strong>Wing Guard </strong>in <strong>Cloud City. </strong>The droids boast jump jets that allow them to fly up to the highest platforms, though they can maintain this flight for only a <strong>round </strong>at a time. These <strong>patrol droids</strong> are designed to close to <strong>melee range</strong> with opponents and subdue them physically, though they are also equipped with <strong>ranged weapons</strong> if needed.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This tall battle droid resembles a skeletal humanoid with a smooth, featureless faceplate broken up by a pair of illuminated eyes.

They prefer to fight in <strong>melee</strong> with their <em>vibropikes</em> because their high <strong>Strength</strong> makes their <strong>attacks</strong> particularly devastating. If they see that the players are gaining an advantage, they will try to <strong>shove</strong> their foes off the platform, though they usually try to <strong>shove</strong> the players onto the platform below so they don’t die from the fall. The droids will use their jump jets to move between the three platforms safely, hoping to harass the players.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Given the odd hour at which this encounter takes place, there should be few bystanders to witness the fight. If the players manage to subdue or kill all of the <strong>Wing Guard,</strong> they may face repercussions later if it is discovered that they were responsible. However, given the need for the players to move about the city unhindered during the <strong>sabacc tournament,</strong> you should be careful about branding them as known criminals—at least until the tournament is over and the players find themselves on the wrong side of Imperial (and <strong>Bespin)</strong> law.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Encounter Map</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/3/3-03_on_the_heights.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"477\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"> </p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Features of the Area</strong></p>\n<p>The three landing platforms overlap slightly, allowing flying players (particularly those with jet packs), players with some kind of rope, or simply reckless players to move between the platforms.

/></p>\n<p><strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> is the name given to a series of 10 linked adventures that Gamemasters can use to create an entire campaign for their players. Set in the months after the events of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, the adventures in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign are designed to provide players and GMs with the iconic <em>Star Wars Roleplaying Game</em> experience, set against the backdrop of the tyranny of the Galactic Empire. The <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign takes the heroes all the way from <strong>1st level</strong> up to <strong>20th level</strong>, and features an ongoing storyline that progresses over the course of the campaign. Each adventure can also be played individually, and should provide the heroes with ample challenges to gain <strong>two levels per adventure</strong>. Gamemasters should feel free to use the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> adventures either as an entire campaign or as fillers for their own home campaigns.</p>\n<p>If you are a Gamemaster wishing to run the campaign, read the @JournalEntry[I2Pv3itNmHDdrmPN]{GM's Primer}, which summarizes the overall plot of the campaign and the events of each adventure.</p>","folder":"iGDc7lp2jckSGg1g","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"XJ1kU4P63JNOesou","name":"5-06 The Black Ship","content":"<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">The Black Ship</h2>\n<h4>Setup</h4>\n<p>The cliff wall that runs along the north edge of the landing platform is very rough and has numerous cables and sensors bolted to it. This makes it very easy to climb, only requiring a <strong>DC 7 Strength (Athletics) check</strong> and gives characters the opportunity to take cover if they wish. A cable can be used as an improvised <em>@Compendium[sw5e.vibroweapons.h05hvfoThlmCxW5H]{Electrostaff}</em> but can’t be taken more than <strong>15 feet</strong> from the wall without breaking loose and losing power. A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> allows a wrenched-free cable to incapacitate the <strong>black ship,</strong> stranding the <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> here.</p>\n<p>The <strong>slavers</strong> also have <strong>four nashtah,</strong> six-legged lizards about the size of a big dog.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the heroes approach the site of the slaver ship (named <em><strong>The Bloody Credit</strong></em>), read the following.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The foul scent of acidic vapors chokes the air, and you hear the barks of rushed orders ahead of you. Turning the corner, you see a group of Trandoshans in old military jumpsuits, along with four multilegged lizard beasts, all wearing breath masks and driving a line of Nazren toward the black ship. You’ve seen ships of this type before—they carry slaves. The Trandoshans seem to be in a hurry and aren’t being gentle. They cuff and beat the Nazren, forcing the prisoners along a docking wall covered with cables and into the ship’s loading ramp.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4>Slavers</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Trandoshan slavers</strong> are experienced mercenaries who fought as Separatist soldiers during the Clone Wars and who have been capturing and moving Wookiees for the Empire. Because they usually want to capture subjects alive and often have to deal with rebellious <strong>slaves</strong> without damaging them too badly, the <strong>slavers</strong> have more experience in <strong>unarmed combat</strong> than with firing <em>blasters.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Nine Trandoshans</strong> remain inside the ship, trying to repair its systems so that it can take off again. Meanwhile, <strong>nine</strong> more <strong>slavers</strong> are rounding up <strong>Nazren</strong> outside.</p>\n<p>Much of the cargo space in <em><strong>The Bloody Credit</strong></em> has been converted to slave pens. The <strong>Trandoshans</strong> use all the regular passenger space for themselves, allowing the ship to have a larger-than-normal crew.</p>\n<p>Each <strong>trandoshan</strong> has <strong>1,000 credits</strong> on them, for a total of <strong>9,000 credits</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>9 @Actor[KMOn9B1iX02WU3Ld]{Trandoshan Slavers}</strong></p>\n<h4>Nashtah</h4>\n<p>Like the <strong>slavers,</strong> the <strong>nashtah</strong> have breath masks strapped on to protect them from the smoke. Choose one of the <strong>slavers</strong> to be the <strong>nashtah</strong> handler. If that slaver is taken out, the <strong>nashtah</strong> flee the scene if they are <strong>intimidated,</strong> take more than <strong>half</strong> their <strong>hit points</strong> in damage, or suffer any <strong>fear</strong> effect. Otherwise, the beasts <strong>attack</strong> the closest hero at the beginning of each <strong>round.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4 @Actor[YbdApIJ3LizG55gX]{Nashtah}</strong></p>\n<h4>Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Trandoshans</strong> want to escape with enough <strong>slaves</strong> to turn a profit. If that doesn’t seem likely, however, they run for it. If they can get all their forces into the <strong>ship,</strong> it takes off with whatever <strong>slaves</strong> are already inside. If the heroes gain control of the ship, the remaining <strong>slavers</strong> run into the city and try to hide from the <strong>Nazren’s</strong> wrath.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If <em><strong>The Bloody Credit</strong></em> gets away, the heroes have a few options. If they dare, they can take to their starship and go after it. If they take this approach, run a space battle at the edge of the planet’s ring of dust and debris, using the same rules as in <strong>@JournalEntry[JstAiowdQiod5qtO]{Part 2: Into the Jaws}</strong>. If the combat lasts more than <strong>10 rounds</strong>, <strong>three V-wings</strong> arrive to aid the <strong>slave ship.</strong> Three additional <strong>V-wings</strong> arrive on <strong>round 15</strong>, and the <strong><em>Arkanian Dragon</em></strong> shows up on <strong>round 20</strong>. (If the heroes managed to defeat the <em><strong>Dragon</strong></em> earlier in the adventure, use another Victory II Star Destroyer with the same stats instead.)

The <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> starts the <strong>combat</strong> <strong>1,500 feet</strong> or <strong>30 squares away</strong> from the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, and will be moving directly toward it throughout the <strong>encounter.</strong> The players enter the battlefield <strong>1,200 feet behind</strong> the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> on the far side from the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, so that the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> is in the middle. The<strong> TIE fighters</strong> start <strong>600 feet</strong> away from the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> placed between the <strong>hauler</strong> and the <strong>players.</strong></p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>When the <strong>encounter</strong> begins, allow the players to make a<strong> DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A successful <strong>check </strong>allows the players to discover the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> should reach the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> slave ship in <strong>5 rounds</strong>.

Though many of the pilots preferred the durability of the V-wing, the Empire’s mandate that all squadrons convert over to<strong> TIE fighters</strong> has been obeyed. Unfortunately, many of the pilots are not yet accustomed to the <strong>TIE fighter’s</strong> cockpit and maneuvering style. As a result, though the pilots might be considered skilled in the V-wings they trained in, they are reduced to mere competence in the cockpit of a <strong>TIE fighter</strong>. The <strong>12th Squadron</strong> is one of the first fighter groups to convert over entirely, and they have been assigned to the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> at the request of <strong>Valin Draco.</strong></p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:34.2857px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:34.2857px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:34.2857px\"><em>Two large, flat wings flank the eyeball-like cockpit of this TIE fighter, which seems unblemished and without normal wear and tear, as though it just rolled off the assembly line.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>8 @Actor[i659SGD9QinsseAm]{TIE/LN Starfighter}</strong></p>\n<h4>TIE/LN Fighter Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>TIE fighters</strong> launched by the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> were dispatched to ensure that the players could not interfere with the destruction of the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> and the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> two starships that provide major evidence of the Empire’s dealings with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. The <strong>TIE fighters’</strong> primary goal is to delay the players long enough for the <strong>Tibanna</strong> gas hauler to reach the<em><strong> Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>, though if they manage to kill some of the players in the process, they would consider it a victory. As such, they make extensive use of the <strong>Interfere action,</strong> hoping to slow the players by providing <strong>disadvantage</strong> to their <strong>attacks</strong> to destroy the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler.</strong> If the players manage to destroy the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler,</strong> the <strong>TIE fighters</strong> receive new orders to destroy the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> themselves. As a result, the players will need to destroy all of the <strong>TIE fighters</strong> before the slave ship is destroyed.</p>\n<h4>Tibanna Gas Hauler</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> is a custom vehicle designed by the Ubrikkian corporation specifically for the transportation of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> from <strong>Cloud City.</strong> The starship operates via a <strong>droid brain</strong> that receives orders from designated controllers; unlike a slave circuit, the <strong>droid brain</strong> on the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> can make snap decisions on its own to preserve the ship.

Have the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> choose a point within range (its maximum range is 4800 feet, presumably from the edge of the map), barraging a 150-foot area with its Heavy Laster Battery. Each ship that enters the area or starts its turn there is <strong>attacked</strong> by the <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> making a <strong>DC 9 Dexterity Saving Throw</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> with a failed <strong>save</strong> dealing <strong>[[/r 2d6+8[energy] # Energy damage]] damage</strong>) thus turning the <strong>Inquisitor’s</strong> flagship into a dangerous piece of terrain. Keep in mind that adding the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> directly to the fight would likely prove to be too much of a challenge for the players.</p>\n<p>However, using the Star Destroyer merely as a set piece to intimidate the players could heighten the tension in the scene. Just make sure to keep the ship out of weapons range of either the players or the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em> to avoid altering the encounter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/3/3-08_skirmish_over_bespin.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"aBQpachetSlGpNPc","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The three <strong>Quarren</strong> work for <strong>Darga</strong>, but the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> and the <strong>Wookiee</strong> came to the <strong>palace</strong> as part of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> delegation.</p>\n<p>When combat begins, the <strong>assassins</strong> have moved into the guest quarters and have access to the heroes’ rooms. Each of the <strong>Quarren</strong> moves into a different guest room (if the heroes are grouped into one or two rooms, some of the Quarren will move into the same room) to try to kill the heroes in their sleep. The <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> stands guard at one end of the guest quarters hallway in case a hero tries to escape, while the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> poisoner hides in the common area, waiting to strike at anyone who emerges from a room.</p>\n<p>Remember that if the heroes previously caught the <strong>Twi’lek</strong> trying to <strong>poison</strong> <strong>Darga’s drink</strong> and exposed her, she<strong> does not take part</strong> in this encounter.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Read the following text aloud to the heroes:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Late in the evening, the guest quarters of Darga’s palace are quiet and peaceful.

Any heroes who fail the <strong>check </strong>are surprised and do not act during the <strong>surprise round</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Quarren Assassin</h4>\n<p><strong>Darga the Hutt </strong>employs a trio of <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> who also double as bounty hunters, tracking down the crime lord’s enemies or agents that fail to do his bidding. These <strong>assassins</strong> are paid well, and though they are of relatively low level, they have been trained to attack quickly and precisely. The <strong>Quarren</strong> act without speaking a word, using the cover of darkness to sneak up on the heroes.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This slender Quarren wears gray overlapping robes and brandishes a customized blaster pistol.

Skilled with a variety of poisons, she is the <strong>slavers’</strong> clandestine way of dealing with enemies. <strong>Igren Demos</strong> knows this, but he does not tell his master. In exchange for his silence, the majordomo requires a favor, which he calls in to have the <strong>Twi’lek poisoner</strong> and the <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> (detailed below) assist the <strong>Quarren</strong> in taking out the heroes.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Though she might have been beautiful once, this young, green-skinned Twi’lek woman looks like she has seen her fair share of hard times, and now she seems more worn down than youthful.

She used her last spare vial of poison to coat her dagger leaving her with only a <strong>single vial</strong> left if the heroes decide to search her body.</p>\n<h4>Wookie Slaver</h4>\n<p>An exile from his homeworld of <strong>Kashyyyk</strong> and a reviled member of the Wookiee species, this <strong>slaver</strong> has abandoned the honor of his heritage and embraced a life of violence and destruction. Part of the muscle of the <strong>Iron Ring</strong> delegation, the <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> is a big, brutish warrior who fought as a mercenary for the Separatists in the Clone Wars. His bowcaster is the only evidence that he embraces any aspect of his past, and his ability to drop foes quickly has made him an invaluable addition to the slaver ring.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">T<em>his towering Wookiee warrior seems to ooze malice and hatred.

In truth, the <strong>Quarren assassins</strong> believe the order was handed down from <strong>Darga</strong> (though the <strong>Hutt</strong> has no knowledge of the assassination attempt), and the <strong>Twi’lek poisoner</strong> and the <strong>Wookiee slaver</strong> know only that their Zabrak leader ordered them to assist. If <strong>Darga </strong>is confronted, he tells the heroes plainly that he had nothing to do with it, and if the heroes investigate further, they find the servant who delivered “<strong>Darga’s</strong>” order to the Quarren dead in his quarters—killed by<strong> Igren</strong> <strong>Demos </strong>to keep him silent. The <strong>Zabrak slaver</strong> similarly claims that the servant brought him the order to have his comrades join in the assassination attempt. If <strong>Darga </strong>finds out about the <strong>slavers’</strong> involvement, he expels them from his <strong>palace</strong> immediately, warning the <strong>Zabrak</strong> to keep his minions on a tighter leash for their next visit.</p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/2/2-05_a_knife_in_the_dark.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"819\" /></p>","folder":"tGyRjO9FvMNYmhSK","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"ZUdjErWvapAzVLk7","name":"Part 3: Into the Citadel","content":"<h1>Part 3: Into the Citadel</h1>\n<p>When the heroes get their first glimpse of <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> from nearby, most likely when they emerge from the catacombs, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;border-top:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary);height:28.4286px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:28.4286px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:28.4286px\">\n<p><em>It is night in the Magraddor Range, which is appropriate, since the Citadel Inquisitorius is a thing out of nightmares. A towering spire rises into the Prakith sky, a black-on-black vision of dread. Faint lights glow weakly from the higher levels. This is a place of dark acts, where the only light employed is that necessary to advance the Emperor’s aims.</em></p>\n<p><em>In contrast to the obsidian monolith above, the plaza around the Citadel seems almost organic. Ancient. That’s impossible, given the recent arrival of the Empire, but nonetheless, it is so. Cracked and dusty pavement surrounds the Citadel base, punctuated at the sides by eight intricate stone columns a three hundred feet high. Dwarfed by the much taller Citadel at the plaza’s center, these ornately decorated cylinders seem mystical in their arrangement, like an ancient sundial. One of Prakith’s moons shines above, half eclipsed by the Citadel. This is a place for things of the night.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If the heroes came through the Stereb tunnels, they emerge from an overgrown, crumbled opening just below the base of one of the stone columns. These are the <strong>“pores”</strong> of which <strong>Eldr’nol</strong> spoke: Each of the Stereb columns rises from deep underground, and, if the heroes saw them from the air, they’d recognize the columns as something akin to smokestacks. The Stereb built the circle of columns here centuries ago, and Imperial architects took advantage of the paved clearing within the mountains to build the <strong>Citadel.</strong> Aesthetics played a role, as well; locating amid the ancient ruins appealed to the architects’ dark side sensibilities. (Indeed, there is a remote chance that <strong>Darth Andeddu</strong> brought the Stereb to <strong>Prakith</strong> as enslaved builders in the first place, centuries ago, although this is only a possibility.)</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to scale the building-block stonework to the surface of the plaza, and the approach by night is a lucky break. The plaza is not the source of much activity even in daytime. Because of the Stereb columns, most larger transports serve the <strong>Citadel</strong> from a platform near the top of the spire. A circular colonnade surrounds the base, with access points to the <strong>Citadel</strong> underneath the obsidian canopy, but in the dark it’s hard to determine the best route inside. There is some <strong>cover</strong> available for anyone who tries to approach the <strong>Citadel’s</strong> base on foot, but with occasional patrols and meditating <strong>Inquisitors,</strong> the heroes will need to make an important decision.</p>\n<p>A fast dash under the colonnade requires a single <strong>DC 30 Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>; failure initiates the <strong>“@JournalEntry[Tk7T1AHpIdpbdKCF]{9-06 Citadel Security Team}”</strong> (<strong>CST</strong>) encounter and puts the <strong>Citadel</strong> on high alert. If the heroes make the <strong>check</strong> or if they defeat the defenders, they must then make a <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> if they have an <strong>Inquisitor’s</strong> <em>code cylinder</em> to activate the elevator. A failed <strong>check</strong> brings another <strong>CST</strong> encounter; a success allows the heroes to advance to <strong>Route 1</strong> under “<strong>Reaching the Top</strong>”. This is the least ideal method of entry, but it’s the cost of impatience, to a degree. (It’s an administrative entrance, and it hits the most chokepoints on the way to <strong>Master Denia.)</strong></p>\n<p>Pausing to reconnoiter puts the heroes in the position of making a <strong>DC 20 Dexterity Stealth check</strong>, this covers surveying the area and advancing, which might trigger a <strong>security team.</strong> But a success gives the heroes the option of two more points of entry.</p>\n<p><strong>Prisoners’ Entrance:</strong> The first point is an intimidating-looking archway that leads through a gargoyle-decorated passage toward an elevator. This is the “<strong>perp walk</strong>” route for new prisoners, and while it offers the most direct route to the top (<strong>Route 2</strong>), it’s designed to look very threatening. To enter this way, the heroes must make a <strong>DC 23 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong> if they have an <strong>Inquisitor’s</strong> <em>code cylinder</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Service Entrance:</strong> The second point of entry, not too far away, is what appears to be a seldom-used service elevator with a control panel. This elevator leads to <strong>Route 3</strong>, which takes the heroes past the training center. To enter this way, the heroes must make a <strong>DC 26 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>with <strong>advantage</strong> if they have an <strong>Inquisitor’s</strong> <em>code cylinder</em>.</p>\n<p>Heroes cannot activate the elevators until any outstanding <strong>CST</strong> encounters triggered by their actions are resolved. The <strong>Citadel</strong> will not put the elevators into lockdown while they’re still running <strong>Response Teams</strong> downstairs. This is new to them—nobody’s ever been crazy enough to assault the <strong>Citadel</strong> before.</p>\n<h1>Reaching the Top</h1>\n<p><strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> is a maze of elevators, with levels devoted to different purposes. <strong>Lower levels</strong> include living areas and offices for basic support functions; <strong>higher levels</strong> deal with the duties that the <strong>Inquisitorius</strong> was created to perform, such as keeping tabs on <strong>Force-users</strong> and imprisoning and torturing suspects.</p>\n<p>As such, the <strong>Citadel</strong> was designed with various communities of occupants in mind, not for the convenience of anyone trying to zoom to the top quickly. Multiple elevator shafts run only partway up the tower, forcing the heroes to transit floors to reach the next required elevator. This results in a series of chokepoint encounters, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Citadel security teams</strong> on generic levels (A) for you to label as desired;</li>\n<li>The training center (B), populated by <strong>Inquisitors</strong> learning their craft; and</li>\n<li>The prison level (C), the last stop for a hapless <strong>Force-user</strong> on the way to the <strong>torture chamber.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the route the heroes take into the building, they will run through the encounter in one of the possible sequences based on the entrance. Refer to the “Storming the Tower” encounter:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[02LSYyBGlhTlbUmj]{9-07 Storming the Tower}</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Route 1</strong> (administrative entrance): A-A-B-A-C-A</li>\n<li><strong>Route 2</strong> (prisoners’ entrance): A-A-C-A</li>\n<li><strong>Route 3</strong> (service entrance): A-B-A-C-A</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the players struggle or are not being challenged enough and you want to deplete resources, you can run as many or as few of the encounters as you want.</p>\n<p>After concluding the encounters, the players gain access to the torture chamber.</p>\n<h2>Torture Chamber</h2>\n<p>Following the last encounter in “<strong>@JournalEntry[02LSYyBGlhTlbUmj]{Storming the Tower}</strong>,” the heroes hear a familiar voice in agony: the wretched cries of <strong>Master Denia,</strong> coming from the top of a stairwell. Ascending the stairs, they find an octagonal atrium that is <strong>100 feet </strong>from ceiling to floor. Suspended high above the center is a platform where <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> and his droids are abusing <strong>Master Denia.</strong> See “<strong>Torture Chamber</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[HoBpmeXs22bXcP5R]{9-08 Torture Chamber}</p>\n<h2>Another Distress Call</h2>\n<p>Watching <strong>Draco</strong> depart from the landing platform atop the <strong>Citadel,</strong> the heroes realize that their journey is at an end, in more ways than one. A <strong>few hours </strong>of darkness remain, but the <strong>Citadel</strong> is alight with activity below—everyone they might have missed on the way up is now working to secure the facility.</p>\n<p>The most likely means of escape comes from <strong>Jekk Seejo.</strong> After contacting the heroes, <strong>Seejo</strong> waits an appropriate amount of time in orbit and places another <strong>distress call.</strong> But this call is fake. It announces that his ship is out of control and heading for the surface. Somewhere, Imperial controllers, recognizing <strong>Seejo’s</strong> voice, engage in headslaps. Not again!</p>\n<p>The heroes see their ship approaching from the sky at high speed, only to level out in midair near the top of the <strong>Citadel</strong> just before striking the mountains. Unable to land on the platform that <strong>Draco</strong> departed from—the winds are high, and <strong>Seejo</strong> isn’t great in the landing department—the Duros brings the ship to a position just beside and below a jutting surface of the platform. Each hero must make a <strong>DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>to jump the <strong>15 feet down</strong>, taking <strong>falling damage</strong> against the ship’s roof if they fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Comlink</strong> chatter should indicate some degree of confusion; the Empire is at a loss for procedures to deal with an attack on <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius.</strong> It assumed that <strong>Prak City’s</strong> military functions would be a likelier target for sabotage, and that the <strong>Inquisitors,</strong> safe in their secluded mountain retreat, would be the ones moving to the city’s defense. Regardless, there is no point in staying on <strong>Prakith</strong> a <strong>minute</strong> longer, and heroes who choose to linger find the skies quickly filling, first with Imperial speeders and then with fighters attempting to prevent their escape. Gamemasters can turn this into an optional extended encounter, but after escaping the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius,</strong> the heroes should be quite ready to hit the skies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Variant Methods for Citadel Escape</strong></p>\n<p>Since <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> is not entirely reliable, the heroes might make alternative plans for their escape from the <strong>Citadel.</strong> However events progress, the characters have a very narrow window for getting out, and their plans should address that.</p>\n<p>Leaving a hero (instead of <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong>) in <strong>Prak City</strong> with the ship causes events to proceed more or less the same, only without the award for bringing <strong>Seejo</strong> into the resistance.</p>\n<p>As another option, the heroes can try to bluff their way out of the <strong>Citadel.</strong> Considering that they probably caused a good deal of chaos while moving up through the tower, they might be able to descend in disguise if they also engage in a little sabotage along the way. If they manage to flee the <strong>Citadel,</strong> their best move is to retreat down the Stereb staircase, obtain the speeder bikes, and look for another exit farther into the cracked wilderness. Completely backtracking to the Stereb civilization, while possible, runs the risk of revealing the creatures’ existence to the Empire. The <strong>Citadel’s</strong> builders currently believe that whoever built the ruins around and under the <strong>Magraddor Range</strong> are long gone and have no connection with the Stereb found by the Geddis miners.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>Jumping to <strong>hyperspace</strong> puts some welcome distance between the heroes and <strong>Prakith,</strong> but their news about <strong>Master Denia’s</strong> fate is understandably troubling to their allies.

The Bashee, you diverged from the stat block, so I took you on faith there, <strong>Created the Banshee using the Baudo-class star yacht - Modified - there was a note in the shipyard that said that statblock was used for the Dawn of Defiance adventure</strong> but when we get to the TIE and the Z-95, I'll compare your ships to the google docs stat blocks and see if you missed anything (or even more likely missed a bug that we need to hand correct, like I found with the A-wing.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Last Priority, don't touch until right before we release (but I don't want to forget):</p>\n<p>There's a bug that an NPC can't serve in a deployment for a ship. I believe the problem isn't on the ship sheet but the character sheet. You'll notice that the Banshee has a proficiency bonus of +0 even though it should have Okeefe's prof bonus. If you make a scratch version of Okeefe as a PC and give her the right deployments, SHE will transfer her prof bonus to the ship, but this takes a little fudging because among other things a PC doesn't calculate prof bonus the same way an NPC does.</p>\n<p>I think this has to do with the fact that her rank is still 0, even though she HAS deployment ranks. If you give a PC deployment ranks, their overall rank actually goes up, and I think that's the number the starship sheet reads to determine if it takes the character's prof bonus.</p>\n<p>However I've reported this bug and I think it's VERY likely it will be fixed before we release, so I say we build everything assuming it will work right and make a few specific \"Deployment PC versions\" of characters at the very end, just in case we need them to make ships work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I believe the proper foundry notation for damage is 1d6[kinetic] damage, not 1d6 kinetic damage.

In case it's not immediately evident, there's three maps in the journal as a visual aid for the GM. The first is the safehouse. This probably doesn't need a separate scene, it's used in 7-04 already, so a GM can repurpose that scene if needed. The floophouse, however, is a backdoor scene that the adventure provides but doesn't fully outlined as one of those 4e era encounters. It just might happen if the party starts a fight with the thugs. The map guy made maps, so we should probably make a scene, just in case. Drop a 3p0 droid in the lobby and the seven thugs loitering outside. Since the bottom floor has the street, the bottom and top maps cover different-sized areas, so you can't just make them the same size. You'll need to make tiles (They should probably both be in the same scene). The description says the guy's room is 15 foot square, though, so that gives you a scale on the second floor and you should be able to figure out the first floor scale by comparing it to the second floor and then resizing to allow for the street outside.

{"_id":"g0de7VUU1BnwfOCV","name":"Part 2: The Tournament","content":"<h1>Part 2: The Tournament</h1>\n<p>By the time the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> begins, the players should have had time to relax in their suite in the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> for a <strong>day </strong>or <strong>two. Captain Okeefe</strong> remains on board the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> with her droid copilot, occasionally checking in to make sure nothing has gone awry. The players know by now that <strong>Darga </strong>is deep in hiding, and that the Empire is sending a representative to the <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> to make another transaction with the <strong>Hutt</strong> (or one of his agents). The players should have been watching for a communiqué from the Empire (intended for <strong>Baron Kithriss)</strong> that will, with luck, provide them with more information about what will happen at the <strong>sabacc tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players have attempted to find out more about the tournament, they discover with no real issues the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> is held annually, and it is one of the most highly publicized sabacc tournaments in the galaxy.</li>\n<li>This year, the tournament is being held at the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> though past tournaments have been held in other casinos and even at the <strong>Yerith Bespin hotel.</strong></li>\n<li>The buy-in for the <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> is <strong>10,000 credits per person</strong>, with the winner taking the entire prize at the end of the tournament.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Arrival of the Empire</h2>\n<p>Once you feel that the players have had enough time to recuperate from their previous encounters, their involvement in the <strong>Cloud City</strong> <strong>Sabacc Tournament </strong>can begin. As expected, a message comes over the city’s communications system directly to the console in their hotel room. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p>Missive from Coruscant: Transaction codename SARLACC065824 set to occur during Cloud City Sabacc Tournament as planned. The Hutt has assured us that his agent will be present to receive the handoff. An officer from the <em>Assiduous</em> will be taking part in the tournament. The transaction will occur during play so as to avoid arousing suspicion. You are responsible only for observing this transaction and making sure that the Hutt’s agent does nothing to endanger the secrecy of the arrangement. Under no circumstances are you to interfere with the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, send a confirmation message to Coruscant standard relay 88-ShenXesh-3, then return to Chandrila. No further instructions will follow.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With the message received, the players now know what to look for. If they can discover which of the <strong>sabacc players</strong> is <strong>Darga’s</strong> <strong>agent</strong>, and if they can observe the details of the transaction, they can likely find out where the <strong>Hutt</strong> is hiding and perhaps discover the depth of his involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The fact that the Empire refers to the transaction by the <strong>Sarlacc</strong> codename should indicate to the players that they are on the right track.</p>\n<p>If the players are still having trouble deciding what to do, don’t be afraid to remind them that their mission is to discover the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> Knowing that a payment from the Empire is going to take place during the <strong>tournament</strong> gives them a chance to dig deeper into the façade surrounding the project. From this point on, the players know that they need to be present at the <strong>tournament</strong> to learn more about the dealings between the <strong>Hutt</strong> and the Empire. Several ways that they can become involved in the <strong>tournament</strong> are described below. Note that not all of the players need to follow the same path; some might act as bystanders, others might work security, and another player might participate in the tournament. Since all of the events surrounding the tournament take place roughly in the same locale, you need not worry about splitting the party up. They all will be present for most scenes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee I</strong></p>\n<p>At some point during the players’ quest to find their particular niche in the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament, Captain Okeefe</strong> contacts them via comlink to relay a short message. According to <strong>Okeefe,</strong> her droid copilot was able to tap into the city’s central computer to keep an eye on all communications and sensor data flowing through spaceport control. Moments ago, an Imperial I class Star Destroyer whose transponder identified it as the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> dropped out of hyperspace on the edge of the system, escorting a Gallofree Yards Medium Transport (callsign Shackles of Nizon ). The Star Destroyer launched a single Theta -class shuttle, which set a course for <strong>Bespin.</strong> The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> promptly jumped to lightspeed, leaving the Medium Transport behind. Though <strong>Okeefe</strong> doesn’t think that a single shuttle will bring much trouble, she warns the players to be on the lookout for an Imperial presence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Entering the Tournament</h2>\n<p>One of the clearest means of getting a front-row seat for the <strong>tournament</strong> action is to enter the game as a competitor. If the players have <strong>10,000 credits</strong> they are willing to part with, they can buy a seat for their best gambler at one of the tables. If they have achieved greater wealth, they can get more than one player into the game. Each buy-in of <strong>10,000 credits</strong> is enough to get one player into the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>A player entering the <strong>tournament</strong> is interviewed briefly by one of the pit bosses of the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> before being given instructions on when to arrive, where to go, and so forth. The gamblers are not allowed to leave the table except during designated breaks, and each gambler is subject to a thorough search each time he enters or exits the gambling hall. These searches are to prevent cheating and ensure that no one is trying to smuggle <strong>sabacc</strong> <strong>cards</strong> in or out. Lastly, each gambler is required to wear a small pin to show that he is still active in the <strong>tournament;</strong> removing the pin while in the casino will result in immediate expulsion from the game.</p>\n<p>Any players who succeed on a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>can tell that the pin is more than decorative. In truth, each pin is a <em>communications-jamming device.</em> The wearer of a pin cannot use <em>commlinks—</em>they produce only static. An anti-cheating device, the pin prevents gamblers from receiving outside help during the tournament.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Buying Back In</strong></p>\n<p>If one of the players playing in the tournament is eliminated, you have the option of allowing the player to reenter the game. At some point during the <strong>round</strong>, one of the other gamblers suffers a severe reaction to a drink, requiring immediate medical attention. With that gambler eliminated, the tournament administrator allows one of the previously defeated players to step back into the game for a new buy-in of <strong>2,000 credits,</strong> allowing him or her to compete in the hospitalized gambler’s place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Security</h2>\n<p>If the players do a bit of asking around, they find out quickly that <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot,</strong> owner of the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> has been hiring a private security force to help keep things safe at his casino during the <strong>tournament.</strong> With a little diligence, any interested players can set up an interview with <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> about joining his security force. <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> is a large, boisterous man in his late 40s who has owned the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> for decades, and though he is a shrewd businessman, he is friendly and excited to see capable beings taking an interest in the security of the <strong>tournament.</strong> After a few cursory questions about the players (where they are from, what brings them to <strong>Cloud City,</strong> whether they have any outstanding warrants, and so on), <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> makes them an offer: provide security for all <strong>four days</strong> of the tournament at a rate of<strong> 500 credits</strong> <strong>per day</strong>. During that time, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> will arrange special permits for the players that allow them to carry their normal weapons, ignoring <strong>Cloud City’s</strong> usual restrictions. If the players accept his offer, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> gives them their weapons permits immediately and tells them when to arrive and where to go.</p>\n<p>During the <strong>tournament,</strong> the players working security will guard the doors, helping to ensure that no one gets in with an illegal weapon. If they wish to turn a blind eye to their comrades smuggling in weapons, no one will question their searching methods. This is a good way for the players to get some weapons into the tournament; they will come in handy later, when the shooting starts.</p>\n<h2>The Crowd</h2>\n<p>Few spectators are allowed into the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> during the <strong>tournament.</strong> Each competitor is allowed to bring in one guest to observe, but unless the rest of the players have taken jobs with the security team, they need another way to get in. Players may be able to use a <strong>Charisma (Deception)check </strong>at <strong>DC 14</strong> to bluff their way as it shouldn’t be too hard to pose as an important <strong>Cloud City</strong> official or convince the guards that the player is a relative of one of the other competitors.</p>\n<p>Members of the crowd must stand back from the main gambling floor during the <strong>tournament,</strong> but during breaks in the action, they can visit with the competitors, allowing the players to collaborate during the <strong>tournament.</strong> If any player posing as a spectator spends a little too much time socializing with their fellow players on the security team, it might arouse the suspicion of <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot.</strong> Though <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> might not say anything to the players, he orders other members of his security force to keep an eye on the players who recently joined the team. <strong>Mandelbrot’s</strong> warning grants NPC members of the security team <strong>advantage</strong> on <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong> made against those players.</p>\n<h2>Dirty Money</h2>\n<p>If the players are still having trouble finding a good place to be during the <strong>tournament,</strong> they have one more option. Just before the start of the <strong>tournament,</strong> <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> receives a message from <strong>Switch</strong> (the droid crime lord encountered in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>), asking the players to contact him and providing a means of doing so using the city’s communications system. Some of <strong>Switch’s</strong> contacts on <strong>Cloud City</strong> mentioned seeing the players, and considering that they have worked well with the droid in the past, <strong>Switch</strong> thought they might be amenable to working for him during the <strong>sabacc tournament.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Switch</strong> always has an interest in illicit activities throughout the galaxy, and with the amount of <strong>credits</strong> flowing through <strong>Cloud City</strong> during the tournament, the droid wants a piece of the action. <strong>Switch</strong> proposes to have the players influence the outcome of the <strong>tournament,</strong> enabling a victor of <strong>Switch’s</strong> choosing to take the pot. The droid has already supplied the <strong>tournament</strong> entry fee to one of his contacts (the Twi’lek starship <strong>captain Koroma Moro</strong>) but he wants the players to ensure that <strong>Moro</strong> is the victor in the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players assure him that they will help, <strong>Switch</strong> offers them a percentage of the winnings <strong>(5%</strong> of the total pot, though he is willing to increase the percentage to <strong>7%</strong> if the players bargain successfully). <strong>Switch</strong> is not concerned about the players failing to live up to their end of the bargain. He knows that it is in their interest to help <strong>Koroma</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> win, because if he loses, they get nothing.</p>\n<h2>Rogues' Gallery</h2>\n<p>You may wish to keep a list of generic NPCs to flesh out the <strong>tournament’s</strong> competitors. Most of these NPCs can simply be names with a species and a personality attached, because their statistics will not matter for the challenges in this adventure. However, <strong>five gamblers</strong> should be of particular interest to the players. Over the course of the <strong>tournament,</strong> these competitors should stand out as exceptional players and beings of interest. Any one of them could be <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>, though one—<strong>Koroma Moro</strong>—is a bit less suspect because he is known to be in <strong>Switch’s</strong> employ. Before the tournament ends, the players should have gathered enough information to narrow down the possibilities a bit.</p>\n<h3>Creeska</h3>\n<p><strong>Creeska</strong> is a Rodian gambler who has made a name for himself as an exceptionally aggressive competitor. Though he is friendly—and surprisingly likable, for a Rodian—he never wants to back down from a bluff and has used his gambling muscle to intimidate his opponents into making mistakes. <strong>Creeska</strong> wears a bulky jacket made of Krayt dragon leather (or so he claims; in truth, it is merely dewback hide) and is quite generous in sharing his winnings with others in the casino. <strong>Creeska</strong> is also a cheater and should provide a chance for players working as <strong>security guards</strong> to catch him cheating on the <strong>final day </strong>of the tournament.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/creeska/creeska_rodian_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"329\" /></strong></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[l5bvakvUubyNzIiy]{15 - Handout 15 - Creeska}</p>\n<h3>Silas Draver</h3>\n<p>Cool, suave, and sophisticated, <strong>Silas Draver</strong> is the perfect image of the Human gambler. With long black hair pulled back in a ponytail and a mustache that droops down both sides of his mouth, <strong>Silas</strong> always wears a confident smirk, and he always speaks as though he knows something that the person he’s talking to does not. <strong>Draver</strong> is a savvy gambler who plays it close to his chest; he is also a <strong>con artist</strong> who has managed to get several of his cronies into the list of approved spectators. If he loses, he is planning on<strong> stealing the pot</strong>, and he has sabotaged <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>sabacc dealer droids</strong> to help further that scheme. He has also paid a <strong>security guard</strong> handsomely (and offered a percentage of the prize to him as well) to overlook the <strong>weapons</strong> carried by <strong>Draver</strong> and his <strong>cronies.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/silas%20draver/silas_draver_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"375\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[2FFTvoHbYXatdPkh]{04 - Handout 4 - Silas Draver}</p>\n<h3>Lady Mirana Fioro</h3>\n<p>Looking somewhat out of place among the gamblers and card sharks, <strong>Lady Mirana Fioro</strong> is a Hapan woman who looks as though she just stepped out of a royal court. In truth, however, she is merely a <strong>con artist</strong> who specializes in running scams while impersonating a Hapan noble. The word that best describes her attitude is “<strong>frosty</strong>”—she barely has a second word for anyone, and she rebuffs any advances. <strong>Mirana Fioro</strong> is also <strong>Darga the Hutt’s agent</strong>, and her sole purpose in entering the <strong>tournament</strong> is to receive the payment from the Imperial officer and obtain the information that <strong>Darga</strong> needs to take control of the Medium Transport delivered by the Empire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/lady%20mirana%20fioro/lady_mirana_fioro_art.webp\" width=\"521\" height=\"499\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[0RprsORSXMdi2xwQ]{16 - Handout 16 - Lady Mirana Fioro}</p>\n<h3>Koroma Moro</h3>\n<p><strong>Koroma Moro</strong> is a starship captain who also happens to be an exceptional gambler. He has hauled cargo for <strong>Switch</strong> in the past, and when <strong>Switch</strong> offered to front his entry fee, the Twi’lek knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up. <strong>Koroma</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> is a polite but secretive man who has had a number of unfortunate incidents with the authorities since the Empire came to power. As such, he is always cautious when approached by new people, but if any of the players mention <strong>Switch,</strong> <strong>Moro</strong> lets his guard down a bit, though he is still unwilling to discuss the details of his relationship with the droid crime lord.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark)\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/koroma%20moro/koroma_moro_art.webp\" width=\"250\" height=\"501\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[CDzL77Ldx0pwyifJ]{14 - Handout 14 - Koroma Moro}</p>\n<h3>Vorn Zaday</h3>\n<p>A quiet Neimoidian woman, <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong> is a skilled <strong>sabacc player</strong> who is almost completely unknown to others on the tournament circuit. <strong>Vorn</strong> was a minor dignitary in the Trade Federation who became quite skilled at the game while playing with the officers aboard a Separatist starship during the Clone Wars. She now lives on <strong>Cato Neimoidia,</strong> but she has no connection to<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Her presence in the tournament is just a coincidence, but it might be enough to throw the players off of <strong>Mirana Fioro’s</strong> trail.</p>\n<p><img style=\"border:1px solid var(--color-border-dark);text-align:center;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/vorn%20zaday/vorn_zaday_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" />@JournalEntry[pEa4mHFnv3pC7WYQ]{17 - Handout 17 - Vorn Zaday}</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[S4IY5yMBek0ltyeX]{Rogues' Gallery}</p>\n<h2>Days 1 to 2: Elimination Rounds</h2>\n<p>The <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> begins with one of the largest opening ceremonies that <strong>Cloud City</strong> has ever seen. More than <strong>51 competitors</strong> have entered the <strong>tournament</strong> (plus any players who entered), and the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> is packed with players and spectators. When the day begins, read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The first day of the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament opens with hundreds of sentient beings packed into the Royal Casino. Members of many species dot the predominantly Human audience, and the sounds of droids dealing sabacc cards rise over the din. The clank of glasses and hum of conversation fills the air, but at each of the sabacc tables, there is mostly silence except for the occasional words of a gambler placing his bets. Servant droids wheel about in the crowd, and members of the Royal’s security force keep a watchful eye over the proceedings.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Each <strong>sabacc table</strong> has only <strong>five</strong> or<strong> six players</strong> at any time, though as the<strong> first two days</strong> wear on,<strong> all but two players</strong> from each of the <strong>10 tables </strong>will lose out of the game. Over the course of the<strong> </strong>first days of the tournament, players fulfilling many different roles will have a chance to interact with the events surrounding the <strong>tournament.</strong> Below, you will find entries for each of the suggested roles for players involved in the <strong>tournament.</strong> If the players chose to involve themselves in some other way, feel free to adapt these scenarios to interact with the players. Not only do these scenarios provide something for the players to do each day, but they also provide hints as to who is working for <strong>Darga </strong>and who is not.</p>\n<h3>Tournament Competitors</h3>\n<p>On either the <strong>first</strong> or <strong>second day,</strong> one player participating in the tournament has a chance to interact with the officer from the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em>. The two are paired up at one of the <strong>sabacc tables,</strong> and as the day wears on, the player should have a chance to talk to the officer, who names himself <strong>Lt. Armen Arandis. Lt. Arandis</strong> wears his Imperial uniform during the tournament, and each day it looks crisp, clean, and neatly pressed. He is young, perhaps not long out of the Imperial Academy, and his cool gaze is disrupted only by a long scar that cuts diagonally across his face, starting at one temple, crossing his right eye, and ending at his upper lip. <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is the picture of Imperial discipline, and he is also an excellent gambler. He begins with an unfriendly attitude toward anyone else in the tournament. He is not comfortable being in an environment that has not accepted Imperial rule, and from his point of view, every patron of the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> could very well be a dangerous criminal.</p>\n<p>If the player sitting at his table can manage to shift his attitude to at least indifferent, <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> will talk cordially to the player while they play <strong>sabacc.</strong> Though he is not forthcoming with information, there are a few things he will share, but only if asked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What is an Imperial officer doing playing in the Cloud City Sabacc Tournament?</strong> “<em>Sabacc is a game of skill, but also one of luck. Much as in battle, best-laid plans can go awry due to random elements. Unfortunately, my fellow shipmates have ceased to be a challenge for me, so I requested leave to come play in the tournament in hopes of seeing how I fare against the rest of the galaxy.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How long have you been playing sabacc? </strong>“<em>I just learned the game a little over a year ago, in the Academy. My Tactics instructor used sabacc analogies frequently to illustrate his points, so I sought out the game</em>.”</li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the competition?</strong> “<em>Not Much.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>What ship are you posted on? </strong>“<em>I am a tactical officer aboard the Imperial I -class Star Destroyer the Assiduous . We are on special assignment duty, based out of Prakith.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>Are any other Imperial officers with you?</strong> “<em>No. My fellow crewmen have little appreciation for the game.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any references to <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, Tibanna gas exchanges, or the <strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong> Medium Transport are met by blank looks and bland denials. Though <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is here to make the exchange with <strong>Darga</strong>, nothing he said above is untrue; he was chosen for the assignment because he was an excellent gambler and had a legitimate reason to be in the <strong>tournament.</strong> This first encounter should impress upon the player one thing: <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is a <strong>savvy sabacc player</strong> and could very well be the <strong>best player</strong> in the <strong>tournament.</strong> The player should see how perceptive and shrewd a card player <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> is, along with one more quirk—<strong>after each hand, he stacks his cards neatly on top of one another and slides them face down back to the dealer</strong>. Lt. Arandis does this every single time, with practiced motion, like clockwork. This fact will be important on the <strong>final day</strong>, as it will reveal the identity of <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>The first few days in the <strong>tournament</strong> go relatively smoothly for the players working security. Though <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> continually checks on their vigilance, for the most part, the players are left to their own devices. They can let their allies smuggle weapons into the casino, and they also have a chance to prove that they are doing their jobs by catching another bystander with a weapon. On the <strong>first day</strong>, a Sullustan in fine clothing comes to the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> shows his visitor pass to the guards at the door, and passes through the security checkpoint where the players are stationed. Have each player working security make a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>to notice the Sullustan smuggling in a <em>blaster pistol,</em> granting them <strong>advantage</strong> for giving him a thorough search.</p>\n<p>If they uncover the weapon, they can escort the Sullustan out of the <strong>Royal.</strong> However, if they bring him to <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> instead, the casino’s owner is extremely pleased with their vigilance. As a result, he won’t notify the rest of the security team to keep tabs on the players seen talking together until <strong>day 3</strong> of the <strong>tournament</strong> (for details, see “<strong>The Crowd</strong>” above).</p>\n<p>If the players fail to uncover the weapon, there are not necessarily any negative consequences, though you can use this as a hook for introducing another encounter.</p>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>For any players working for <strong>Switch,</strong> a chance arises to meet <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong>, the Neimoidian gambler recently arrived from <strong>Cato Neimoidia.</strong> She has come to enjoy herself in the tournament and has been saving up for it since the end of the Clone Wars. A stroke of luck brought her a sizable windfall—the Imperial garrison in <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> was accidentally exposed to a biological weapon left over from the Clone Wars, and her antidotes were the only thing that saved the Imperials from being wiped out. As a result, <strong>Zaday</strong> decided to take a vacation to <strong>Cloud City</strong> and test her mettle. She is very good (<strong>+7</strong> to <strong>sabacc deck checks</strong>), and though she hopes to win, she seems to just enjoy being away from the dreary, devastated world she calls her home.</p>\n<p>On the <strong>first day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> any players working for <strong>Switch</strong> notice that <strong>Zaday</strong> has been placed at the same table as <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and the two of them seem to be doing an excellent job of wiping out the rest of the gamblers. They each seem to be winning about the same number of hands, and as their piles of <strong>credits</strong> grow, the other competitors look more and more ashen. At some point during the first few days, a break is called for, and <strong>Zaday</strong> goes to the bar for a drink, sidling up next to the players to place her order. She nods and exchanges pleasantries with the players, giving them an opportunity to ask her a few questions. As with the encounter with <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> the answers she gives could affect how they react to the <strong>final day,</strong> when they become suspicious of her presence at the tournament.</p>\n<p>Here are answers to some common questions the players might have for <strong>Zaday:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How did you get to be so good at sabacc? </strong>“<em>I used to play a lot back when I worked for the Trade Federation, before the Clone Wars.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>You were a Separatist?</strong> “<em>I didn’t have much choice. Fortunately, we avoided most of the fighting, and I was able to retire safely to Cato Neimoidia.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there any strategy you favor?</strong> “<em>Strategy? Oh, I just take each hand as it comes. Sabacc is like that; the chaos is too prevalent to make many plans.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>You’re from Cato Neimoidia?</strong> “Yes, hardly as glamorous as Cloud City. I’ve been trying to get away from that world for a long time now.”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you come to be here? </strong>“<em>I recently made some... good deals that provided me with a small windfall. Just enough to get me here for the tournament.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Darga the Hutt?</strong> “<em>I’m not familiar with any Hutts.</em>” (This is a lie. <strong>Darga </strong>brokered the deal between <strong>Zaday</strong> and the Empire, though she doesn’t want anyone to know that she would even associate with the <strong>Hutt.</strong> Players who see through her deception won’t be able to get this information out of her, though.)</li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Lt. Arandis? Are you affiliated with the Empire?</strong> “<em>I try to mind my own business. If you don’t want someone kicking down your door at night, I’d suggest you consider the same plan.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee II</strong></p>\n<p>Some time during the <strong>first two days</strong> of the tournament, the players receive another message from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>. <strong>Crash</strong> has been intercepting a lot of transmissions that use Imperial codes, and there seems to be a good deal of communications chatter on channels not normally used by civilians. Though the droid has been able to decode only a few of the messages, it appears that the Empire is more active on <strong>Cloud City</strong> than it seems. Moreover, he’s caught references to <strong>Darga </strong>in these messages, confirming that the Hutt is still in <strong>Cloud City,</strong> though <strong>Crash</strong> has no idea where, exactly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>End of the Days' Events</h3>\n<p>By the end of the <strong>second day,</strong> only about <strong>14 competitors</strong> remain in the <strong>tournament,</strong> including <strong>Lt. Arandis, Creeska, Silas Draver, Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and <strong>Vorn Zaday.</strong> Any players in the <strong>tournament</strong> need to make <strong>Charisma (Deception),</strong> <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. A result of<strong> 14 or more</strong> ensures that the player moves on to the next round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> which will whittle the remaining players down to a few, final tables.</p>\n<h2>Interlude: Getting Too Close</h2>\n<p>Between the <strong>first two days</strong> and the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> a message is delivered to the players’ suite at the <strong>Yerith Bespin</strong> while the <strong>tournament</strong> is taking place. The note reads simply, “<em><strong>I know what you’re here for. Meet me on Platform 13-009 at 0200.</strong></em>” The message bears no name and is on a <em>datapad</em> resting in the middle of the floor. In truth, the pad was delivered by some of <strong>Silas Draver’s</strong> thugs, who have noticed some (or all) of the players acting strangely during the <strong>tournament. Draver</strong> doesn’t like how the players have been meddling in the <strong>tournament</strong> so far and wants to get them out of the way before the <strong>final day.</strong> He doesn’t really know why they’re present, but he suspects that they’re cheating somehow.</p>\n<p>One of <strong>Draver’s</strong> thugs sent a message to the <strong>Wing Guard,</strong> claiming that a spice deal would go down on <strong>Platform 13-009</strong> at <strong>0200. Draver</strong> hopes that the guards will detain the players for a few days, at least until the <strong>tournament’s</strong> end. With security already tense with the influx of visitors for the <strong>tournament,</strong> this does seem like a likely scenario. If the players decide to attend the meeting at the appointed time, a confrontation between the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> and the players may ensue.</p>\n<h2>On the Heights</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[WKsslx22jXa5lJbA]{3-03 On the Heights}</strong></p>\n<h2>Day 3: Last Tables</h2>\n<p>The <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> opens with a much smaller field of competitors, though it seems that the number of bystanders has not dwindled. When the players arrive at the <strong>Royal Casino</strong> for the <strong>third day</strong> of competition, read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>The atmosphere in the Royal Casino is much subdued compared to that of the previous two days. Each of the competitors seems to be silently lost in concentration, having survived the free-for-all first rounds. With more than half a million credits on the line, few of the sabacc players seem to be aware of anything outside their small tables. The crowd of onlookers, just as large today as it has been for the first half of the tournament, produces a low murmur of conversation, but much of the wild revelry has died down. A Bith band plays quiet, relaxing music in one corner of the sabacc floor, and the loudest sounds are the clatter of credit chips and sabacc cards at the tables.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>As on the previous days, any players working security can let their comrades smuggle weapons into the casino if they so choose. With fewer competitors, the security team has a bit easier time managing the crowd. However, on this day, they will have to defuse a potentially deadly situation—one of the gamblers isn’t going to accept his losses well. Midway through the <strong>third day,</strong> a Devaronian male named <strong>Szygar</strong> loses a particularly rich pot, going broke and getting eliminated from the <strong>tournament. Szygar</strong> isn’t too pleased about his loss, and he is particularly upset at <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> who won the pot. <strong>Szygar</strong> accuses the officer of cheating, and while the <strong>Lieutenant</strong> sits calmly at the table, <strong>Szygar</strong> begins ranting and yelling that <strong>Arandis</strong> has been cheating the whole time (which is not true).</p>\n<p>Players on the security team notice right away that <strong>Szygar</strong> is shaking his finger at <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and yelling, and as they watch, the Devaronian slides a <em>hold-out blaster</em> from his sleeve, leveling it at the Imperial officer. Though <strong>Szygar</strong> doesn’t fire right away, the situation is precarious, and members of the security team will need to deal with it. <strong>Szygar</strong> is hostile toward <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and unfriendly to everyone else, but if a member of the security team can somehow shift his attitude to indifferent through a <strong>DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>, he’s willing to lower the <em>blaster.</em> He still accuses <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> of cheating, demanding that the officer be removed from the <strong>tournament</strong> and his winnings turned over to <strong>Szygar.</strong> If the players can convince the Devaronian to leave peacefully and turn over his blaster, they will have successfully stopped a potentially deadly situation. However, they do not necessarily need to defuse the situation; if they have the means, they can try to take <strong>Szygar</strong> down violently</p>\n<p>For <strong>Szygar,</strong> use the statistics for <strong>Silas Draver’s goons</strong> from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” encounter. If combat breaks out, use the map from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” encounter. Also, keep in mind that it’s best for <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> to survive this encounter. His presence in the final round of the <strong>tournament</strong> will facilitate the revelation of <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> as <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Bystanders</h3>\n<p>The players in the crowd will have a chance to come face to face with <strong>Darga’s agent </strong>in the <strong>tournament, Lady Mirana Fioro.</strong> The Hapan woman has been doing quite well so far, and it already looks as though she will be one of the competitors to make it to the final table. At some point during the <strong>third day,</strong> <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> takes a break and walks to one of the the observation decks, which happens to be near where any players in the crowd are standing. The observation deck looks out over <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and the orange-red of the setting sun casts the entire deck in a bright glow. <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> looks radiant in this light, and though she retains her unreadable exterior, some players might be tempted to talk to her about the competition. Although she keeps the conversation to a minimum, she is not precisely uncivil, and the players can learn a little more about her, which will help confirm on the <strong>final day</strong> that she is <strong>Darga’s agent</strong> and give the players a chance to follow her after the <strong>tournament</strong> is over.</p>\n<p>Below are answers to some common questions the players might have for <strong>Lady Fioro:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why are you playing in the tournament?</strong> \"<em>The money, is, of course, no object for me. But someone has to show this riff-raff that someone will always be their superior</em>\"</li>\n<li><strong>What do you think of the tournament so far?</strong> “<em>I am surprised that some of these players have gotten so far. Of course, many things surprise me here. I would have thought that my room in the famed Yerith Bespin hotel would be a little nicer than the peasant hovels on Hapes, but I can see that I was mistaken</em>.”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you become so good at sabacc?</strong> “<em>My late husband taught me the game. He was an exceptional player, but before his death I had surpassed him.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there any particular strategy you favour?</strong> “<em>The only way to play sabacc is to play aggressively. Anything less is certain to fail.</em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">”</span></li>\n<li><strong>Do you know Darga the Hutt? Have you dealt with the Empire?</strong> “<em>Such nonsense. I’m here to play sabacc and win, and that’s all.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>On the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament, Switch</strong> sends a message to the players, which is delivered by the hotel staff of the <strong>Yerith Bespin. Switch</strong> has heard that <strong>Captain Moro</strong> is doing well, but he would like to help the Twi’lek reach the final round of the competition. The droid crime lord has sent the players a piece of software for the <strong>sabacc dealer droids</strong> that will twist the luck of the draw in <strong>Moro’s</strong> favor. The tricky part is that the players will have to physically insert a memory stick into the dealer droid to upload the software, a difficult prospect given the heightened security surrounding the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<p>The players should come up with a plan for installing the software. They might choose to disguise themselves as technicians performing maintenance on the droid, though such a deception would be difficult to believe, especially for <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot.</strong> Players can attempt to slide the memory stick into the dealer droid when no one is looking, and if other players create a distraction of some kind, it can give the player with the stick <strong>advantage</strong> on a <strong>Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>When the players attempt to insert the cheating software, use the statistics from the <strong>On the Heights</strong> encounter for <strong>Bespin Security Guards</strong> for the rest of the security team. You can also throw other complications at the players to keep them on their toes. For example, another <strong>technician</strong> might walk up and start tinkering with the droid just as the player approaches it, or one of the other <strong>sabacc players</strong> might turn to face the droid at just the wrong moment. These complications can add tension to the scene, but they shouldn’t stop the players from completing this minor task.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if the players don’t care about helping <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> they can alter the software so that it provides <strong>advantage</strong> on <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck) checks</strong> to one of their allies instead. A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>alters the software to help out a particular player, but the software still has to be installed in one of the dealer droids.</p>\n<h3>End of the Day's Events</h3>\n<p>By the end of the <strong>third day,</strong> only <strong>seven</strong> or <strong>eight</strong> competitors should remain in the tournament, including <strong>Lt. Arandis, Creeska, Silas Draver, Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro,</strong> and <strong>Vorn Zaday.</strong> Any players playing in the <strong>tournament</strong> need to make <strong>Charisma (Deception), Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. A result of <strong>18</strong> or more ensures that the player moves on to the next round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> which will determine the champion. If two or more players are playing in the <strong>tournament,</strong> only the player who gets the <strong>highest result</strong> advances to the <strong>final table</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee III</strong></p>\n<p>Some time during the <strong>third day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> the players receive another message from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong>.</em> According to <strong>Crash,</strong> Imperial communications chatter has died down, and the reason seems to be that <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> made it to the final table in the <strong>tournament.</strong> Apparently, the Empire had a contingency plan in place on the off chance that <strong>Arandis</strong> didn’t reach the final table on his own.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>Crash</strong> has been monitoring communications from the Medium Transport <strong>Shackles of Nizon,</strong> which is still in orbit over the planet. He has been picking up infrequent signals from the ship that are consistent with signals used by slave circuits, which are used to control starships from a distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Day 4: Final Round</h2>\n<p>On the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>tournament,</strong> the only competitors left are those who have played a significant role in the adventure thus far. If a player has made it to the <strong>final table,</strong> he or she has the chance to become the next champion of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> and be known as one of the most talented players in the galaxy. More importantly, though, the players will learn the identity of <strong>Darga’s agent</strong> and the details of the exchange, and they will also be on the right path to finding the <strong>Hutt</strong> and bringing him to justice.</p>\n<p>Only one table remains on the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> Each of the competitors is intensely focused on the hand of <strong>sabacc cards</strong> in front of them, and there is a tension in the air as they compete to see who will take home an incredible prize. All eyes are on the central table, and the Bith band from the day before produces only the faintest background music. The crowd has not thinned, but it now surrounds the last table, which is illuminated by lights from overhead. With the house lights dimmed, the <strong>final table</strong> in the middle of the room glows like an incandescent torch in the dark casino.</p>\n<h3>Casino Security</h3>\n<p>As the <strong>final day</strong> of the tournament wears on, any players working security have a chance to catch <strong>Creeska,</strong> the Rodian player, cheating with a <strong>skifter.</strong> A <strong>skifter</strong> is a special <strong>sabacc card</strong> that can be changed by tapping on the correct corner of the card. Allow each player working security a <strong>DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>to notice <strong>Creeska</strong> slipping the <strong>skifter</strong> from his coat during one of the <strong>sabacc</strong> hands. If a player notices the <strong>skifter,</strong> he can point it out to the rest of the <strong>security team</strong> or to <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot. Creeska</strong> is arrested, all the while protesting his innocence, and dragged off by the <strong>security force.</strong></p>\n<p>If the players do not notice <strong>Creeska</strong> cheating, he retains the <strong>skifter</strong> but loses and gets eliminated from the <strong>tournament</strong> anyway. Unfortunately, he uses the <strong>skifter</strong> to win hands against both <strong>Captain Moro</strong> and any player still in the tournament, <strong>disadvantage</strong> on their <strong>checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>tournament.</strong></p>\n<h3>Bystanders</h3>\n<p>On the <strong>final day</strong> of the <strong>tournament, Silas Draver</strong> pays a handsome bribe to a member of the <strong>Royal’s security force</strong> to get his comrades into the <strong>casino</strong> with their <strong>weapons.</strong> Allow any players in the crowd to make a <strong>DC 17 Perception check</strong> to notice several of <strong>Draver’s thugs</strong> being let in with their weapons by the <strong>security guard.</strong> If the <strong>check</strong> is successful, the players can report what they saw to any member of the <strong>security force.</strong> An investigation reveals the <strong>two thugs</strong> who smuggled in weapons, as well as the <strong>guard</strong> who was bribed. If the players successfully reveal <strong>Draver’s thugs,</strong> remove <strong>two</strong> of his <strong>goons</strong> from the “<strong>Sabacc Table Showdown</strong>” <strong>encounter,</strong> but award <strong>XP</strong> as though the party had defeated those <strong>two goons</strong> just the same.</p>\n<h3>Working for Switch</h3>\n<p>Despite his successes earlier in the <strong>tournament,</strong> <strong>Captain Moro</strong> is not faring well on this <strong>final day.</strong> If the players did not already introduce themselves to <strong>Moro</strong> as agents of <strong>Switch,</strong> the droid sends a message to the Twi’lek, explaining that the players are there to help him. During breaks in the action, <strong>Moro</strong> may seek out the players for counsel in the final round of the <strong>tournament.</strong> If they choose, they can advise him on his play, using observations they have made in the first few days to increase his chances of success. One player working for <strong>Switch</strong> can make a <strong>DC 13 Wisdom check</strong> to aid <strong>Captain Moro</strong> on his own <strong>checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>fourth day,</strong> granting him <strong>advantage.</strong></p>\n<p>Furthermore, if the players interacted with <strong>Vorn Zaday</strong> earlier in the <strong>tournament,</strong> they can tip <strong>Moro</strong> off to her personality, particularly if they reveal her <strong>“chaotic”</strong> outlook on the game. Doing so imposes <strong>disadvantage</strong> on <strong>Zaday’s checks</strong> to gamble at the end of the <strong>tournament,</strong> decreasing the chance that she will beat <strong>Moro’s check.</strong> Similarly, if any of the players managed to talk to <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> they can impose <strong>disadvantage</strong> on her <strong>check</strong> to gamble by revealing her <strong>aggressive strategy</strong> to <strong>Moro.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Message from the Banshee IV</strong></p>\n<p>Just before the players witness the exchange below between <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> and <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> contacts them via <em>comlink</em> to say that Imperial chatter has exploded to a new high, and that the exchange must be close to occurring. This should keep the players on the alert for the final round of the <strong>tournament,</strong> and it can help any players who are struggling to identify <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Tournament Competitors</h3>\n<p>Near the end of the <strong>tournament</strong> (this should be the last scenario before the final <strong>gamble checks</strong> are made), the players finally have a chance to learn the truth about which gambler is working for <strong>Darga</strong>. One particular hand comes about in which <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> has a clear advantage. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>Lady Fioro holds her hand close to her chest, a confident smile gracing her lips. One by one, the other competitors fold, until only the Imperial officer Lt. Arandis and the Hapan woman remain in the game. Another round of betting raises the stakes, but it seems as though Lt. Arandis is feeling out her hand. He watches her for a long moment, eyeing her with the same savvy look he has given every other player he has defeated over the course of the tournament.</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>“<em><strong>I will wager every credit I have,</strong></em>” he says, pushing a pile of chips to the center of the table. The crowd gasps, but the other players—all except <strong>Lady Fioro</strong>—look confused. Her smile, however, deepens, and she reveals her hand: <strong>pure sabacc</strong>, the best possible hand in the game.</p>\n<p>A cheer erupts from the crowd, but it is what happens next that draws your eye. <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> tosses his cards haphazardly on the table, but as the <strong>credit chips</strong> are slid across the table to <strong>Lady Fioro,</strong> he begins arranging the cards once more. From left to right, he places the <strong>One</strong> <strong>of Coins</strong>, the <strong>Three of Sabers</strong>, the <strong>Seven of Flasks</strong>, then <strong>two credit</strong> chips, followed by <strong>Master of Staves</strong>, and lastly the <strong>Queen of Air and Darkness</strong>, sliding them all into the neutral field to keep them from shifting. An instant later, you notice that they produce a number sequence: 137.12. While the audience cheers, <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> stares intently at the cards, as though burning the sequence into her mind.</p>\n<p>Based on their earlier interactions with <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> the players should know that such a play was highly irregular for him. Normally, he is conservative and is not easily baited by bluffs, but his play at the end seemed to indicate that he had been tricked into wagering his entire stake. Not only does the loss remove <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> from the <strong>tournament</strong> (a fact that he seems to show no remorse for), it also gives <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> a significant advantage going into the final hands of the <strong>tournament,</strong> as his stake was quite sizable.</p>\n<p>Additionally, his behavior at the end of the hand should rouse the players’ suspicions, especially given that he specifically arranged the cards to produce the numeric sequence and slid them into the neutral field to keep them from randomizing. If the players have not already figured it out, allow them to make an<strong> Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to realize that the numeric sequence corresponds to a <strong>communications frequency </strong>used by starships, particularly<strong> slave circuits</strong>.</p>\n<p>They should realize what has transpired: <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> transferred his winnings to <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> so that she would win the <strong>tournament,</strong> and he also communicated the frequency of the <strong>slave circuit</strong> for the <strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong> . <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> is <strong>Darga’s agent</strong>, and the players should know this now. Unfortunately, before they have a chance to confront her, they will have to deal with <strong>Silas Draver</strong> and his <strong>goons.</strong></p>\n<p>If no players are participating in the <strong>tournament</strong> at this point, this scenario can play out for <strong>bystanders</strong> as well (especially if any players who met <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> on the <strong>first day</strong> are still present in the audience).</p>\n<h3>End of the Day's Events</h3>\n<p>At the end of the <strong>final day,</strong> only a small number of competitors remain: <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> (<strong>+8</strong> to their<strong> checks</strong>), <strong>Captain Moro</strong> (<strong>+5</strong> to their <strong>checks), Vorn Zaday</strong> (<strong>+7</strong> to their <strong>checks),</strong> and (if applicable) the player participating in the <strong>tournament.</strong> Have these competitors make<strong> Charisma (Deception)</strong>, <strong>Intelligence (sabacc deck)</strong>, or <strong>Wisdom (Insight) checks</strong>. The character with the highest result wins the <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament.</strong> Though this will determine the winner, at least one NPC does not have a chance to win: <strong>Silas Draver.</strong></p>\n<h2>Concluding the Tournament</h2>\n<p>Once the victor of the <strong>tournament</strong> has been determined, <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot</strong> comes to the table to congratulate the winner. In a ceremony as much for the crowd as for the winner, <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> drones on about the excellent competition. He has had the <strong>credits</strong> transferred to a special account that only the <strong>tournament</strong> winner can access, and he hands over a datapad containing the access codes for the account. The crowd cheers, and things finally seem to be winding down, when <strong>Silas Draver</strong> decides to make his move.</p>\n<p><strong>Draver</strong> is not one to take losing kindly, and as such he has prepared for this contingency in advance. <strong>Draver</strong> draws a weapon, and several of his goons push forward out of the crowd, threatening to kill <strong>Mandelbrot</strong> and many others if the <em>datapad</em> isn’t handed over. Surprisingly, most of the <strong>tournament’s</strong> competitors and spectators abided by the “<strong>no weapons</strong>” rule, so none is able to stop <strong>Draver</strong> and his <strong>thugs.</strong> To demonstrate how serious he is, <strong>Draver</strong> activates special programming he had installed into <strong>three</strong> of the <strong>sabacc dealer droids,</strong> revealing them to be armed with blaster weapons.</p>\n<p>The players will need to deal with <strong>Draver</strong> to keep him from getting away with the <strong>credits.</strong> Additionally, he points his blaster at <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> and threatens to take her hostage to keep him safe all the way to the landing pad where his ship is waiting.</p>\n<h2>Sabacc Table Showdown</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[Kv8ka6rkvypUYHPg]{3-04 Sabacc Table Showdown}</strong></p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The area is considered to be in dim light for the purposes of <strong>Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong>. If they detect the heroes and are close enough, the <strong>hunters</strong> engage in <strong>melee;</strong> otherwise, they open fire with their <em>blasters.</em></p>\n<p>Their leader, <strong>Sisla,</strong> is at a platform at one end of the catwalks, arguing with <strong>Resh,</strong> who is on a separate, higher platform. The only way up to the platform appears to be to climb the structure supporting it from each catwalk, and a <strong>bounty hunter</strong> is climbing up from each catwalk while <strong>Sisla</strong> forces <strong>Resh</strong> to keep his head down. The platform is <strong>15 feet above </strong>the <strong>catwalks</strong> and requires a <strong>DC 17 Strength (Athletic) check</strong> if the climber lacks a <strong>climbing speed.</strong> If a climber fails the <strong>check,</strong> they fall into the black oil covering the floor below but takes<strong> no damage</strong>. Anyone in the oil can use their <strong>action</strong> to reach a piece of debris or crate large enough to support themselves if they do not possess a <strong>swim speed.</strong> When the heroes arrive, the climbing <strong>hunters</strong> are halfway up the ladder and will need to make another <strong>check.</strong></p>\n<p>Once the <strong>bounty hunters</strong> are aware of the heroes, they <strong>open fire,</strong> trying to keep one eye on the heroes and one eye on <strong>Resh.</strong> The <strong>Sullustan</strong> initially keeps his head down, but if it appears that the heroes are winning, he takes potshots from the platform at the <strong>bounty hunters.</strong></p>\n<h4>Sisla's Hunters</h4>\n<p><strong>Sisla’s hunters</strong> are a group of <strong>Devaronians</strong> out for some adventure while making a few <strong>credits.</strong> They have traced <strong>Resh</strong> for too long to give him up.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The Devaronians wear worn gray armor that has seen a lot of action.

Once the <strong>hunters</strong> are dealt with, the heroes must make their way up to <strong>Resh</strong> and convince him to tell them about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> He is astonished that anyone else knows about it. Offering him a way off the planet is the best method of getting him to open up.

Since their last adventure, the heroes have spent some downtime aboard the Nebulon-B frigate <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, which is apparently owned by <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. The ship spends all of its time in deep space, between worlds and away from major hyperspace routes, and it currently serves as a mobile safe house for former Imperial <strong>Admiral Gilder Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> was recently rescued from an Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> (either by the heroes, if they played in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, or by other agents of<strong> Bail Organa </strong>if they didn’t) and brought to the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>to be debriefed. <strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> is the commanding officer of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, and he has overseen <strong>Varth’s</strong> safety and debriefing over the last few weeks. The whole time, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> has made it clear that no one should mention <strong>Bail Organa’s </strong>name because the Senator cannot risk being known to be involved in case the Empire happens upon the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. Even <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> does not know for certain that it was <strong>Organa </strong>who had him rescued (unless the heroes told him, of course).</p>\n<p>In the time between the end of <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em> and the beginning of <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, you should feel free to include encounters with <strong>Captain Verana</strong>, <strong>Gilder Varth</strong>, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> (the owner and operator of the Baudo -class Star Yacht, the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>). The heroes should get to know these three characters a bit better because all of them will have roles of varying importance throughout the campaign. When <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em> opens, the heroes should be fully healed and have had a chance to obtain needed supplies and resources. The <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> is a well-stocked ship and can provide the group with most mundane items.</p>\n<h2>The Briefing</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins when the heroes are summoned to the briefing room aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. When they arrive, they find that <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> awaits them, now dressed in the uniform of an Alderaanian ship officer. At his side is a small yellow-and silver astromech droid that whistles softly as it interfaces with a computer system. Once the heroes arrive, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The briefing room aboard the </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Resurgence</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> is clean and white, with several benches wrapping smoothly around a holographic projector seated on a raised dais in the center of the room. The projector springs to life, and the blue-tinted hologram of a Hutt appears to hover a few inches away from the projector’s three curved prongs. With a brusque clearing of his throat, former Imperial officer </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Gilder Varth</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> begins to speak, wasting little time on pleasantries.</span></em></p>\n<p><em>“Before the Empire decided my conscience was a liability,” he says, “I was involved peripherally in a top-secret plan known as the Sarlacc Project. While the details of the project are unknown to me, I was involved in the transfer of large sums of credits and resources to the project. Whatever the project entails, it is taking up a lot of the Empire’s time and effort. Moreover, I believe that this Sarlacc Project is destroying the lives of thousands of sentient beings; casualty reports crossed my desk on a regular basis.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Unfortunately, I don’t know much more than that. However, during my brief brushes with the project, I discovered that the Imperial Navy was hiding the program’s existence from the Senate by transferring resources through secondary sources. Resources were routed through the Corporate Sector, through fake contractors, and through the criminal underworld to keep a trail from leading back to the project.</em></p>\n<p><em>“One such secondary source was a Hutt crime lord named Darga. Like all Hutts, Darga is a slimy gangster whose love of credits is exceeded only by his love of power. Part of my job involved transferring resources to Darga, and in turn arranging for Imperial agents to take control of other resources from the Hutt’s organization. These were not simply transfers of credits. The items being traded were not specified, but physical resources were definitely being exchanged. Though it’s not much, this is the only lead we have. “Captain Verana has charged me with helping to uncover more about the Sarlacc Project, and he has authorized me to use you as my agents. We need you to travel to the planet of Cato Neimoidia and find Darga the Hutt. See if you can learn what he is trading in and how it relates to the Sarlacc Project.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> keeps the briefing short and sweet. He has an air about him that immediately recalls his military past; though he is not unfriendly, he spares no time for idle chatter. It should be clear to the heroes that <strong>Varth</strong> has not adjusted to life outside of the Imperial Navy; he still acts with the same rigidity that is characteristic of all Imperial officers. He seems uncomfortable in his Alderaanian uniform, but his professionalism won’t allow him to voice any complaints. The man is all business, and though he seems genuine in his assertions, he remains largely unreadable. After the briefing, the heroes might have some questions about their mission. The following section provides answers to common questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why should we do this for you?</strong> “<em>In exchange for your assistance, Captain Verana has authorized me to pay each of you a modest sum. Additionally, this may be a chance to discover what the Empire is planning with the Sarlacc Project—which could have big repercussions if I am right.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What else do you know about the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>Not much more than I’ve told you. My only involvement came in managing resources, and most of those transactions were encoded.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to find Darga the Hutt? </strong>“<em>Unfortunately, Darga’s exact whereabouts are unknown. However, he has been seen in the Cato Neimoidian city of Zarra. Chances are that someone in the city knows where he is.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How do we discover the extent of Darga’s involvement in the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>Darga is not one to give up his secrets easily, but he has been known to take associates into his trust. If you can get inside his palace, he might reveal what is going on—or you might be able to find out by snooping around.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What can you tell us about Zarra?</strong> “<em>Zarra was heavily damaged during the Clone Wars, and half of the city is still in ruins. The few residents that have chosen to remain inhabit a cluster of settlements on one end of the city.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to get to Cato Neimoidia?</strong> “<em>Captain Verana has chartered passage for you aboard the Banshee, the transport vessel captained by Sirona Okeefe. After helping you rescue me from my prison on Felucia, Captain Okeefe quickly found herself on retainer.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/resurgence_nebulon-b_escort_frigate_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[SyI9doYoK0fiAtkf]{09 - Handout 9 - Resurgence}</p>\n<h2>Arrival</h2>\n<p>The trip to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> is uneventful, and when the heroes arrive, they find a planet that is far from its former glory in the days before the Clone Wars. A world in the <strong>Colonies</strong>, <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> should be far more populated than it is. When the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>drops out of hyperspace, any heroes in the cockpit can see that there is very little traffic traveling to and from the world. As the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>descends toward the planet, the ship flies through layers of clouds and zooms over cities that are built on massive bridges between rock arches. However, the bridge cities are all but abandoned, seemingly left to rot after the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The heroes land on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> with no difficulty and no visible Imperial presence. The <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>docks at a spaceport in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and though propaganda posters line the spaceport walls, there is no sign of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> or other Imperial officials. Regardless, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> cautions the heroes against acting foolishly. The Empire still controls the planet, and though its current presence is not strong, the situation could change quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Zarra</strong> itself is dilapidated to the point of being hazardous. As the heroes walk the streets, they see little in the way of authority or commerce. Several large buildings that appear to have been lavish palaces of Neimoidian merchants lie half toppled and mostly destroyed. Rubble litters the streets, and landspeeders must veer sharply to avoid chunks of permacrete lying haphazardly in the road. Though a number of beings, mostly shabby-looking Neimoidians, roam the streets, it is clear that <strong>Zarra </strong>has been nearly abandoned since the Clone Wars.</p>\n<h2>Sample Citizens</h2>\n<p>During this part of the adventure, the heroes might come into contact with members of the local populace. Below are several <strong>Cato Neimoidian</strong> citizens to use as quick reference when the heroes begin moving about the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>. Each uses the typical statistics block below. Feel free to invent your own NPCs or introduce other characters here as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Krett, Cantina Owner:</strong> Male Neimoidian, owns the <strong>Federation’s Folly</strong>, a cantina in <strong>Zarra</strong>. A veteran of the Clone Wars, Krett once commanded a Lucrehulk-class battleship but was exiled to <strong>Cato Neimoidia </strong>and is still bitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Nillia, Spaceport Administrator:</strong> Female Neimoidian, keeps tabs on all the ships coming and going from <strong>Zarra</strong>. She is bored with her job and longs to leave, and she seems wistful, as if seeking something more.</li>\n<li><strong>Vigro, Speeder Repairman:</strong> Male Neimoidian, operates <strong>Vigro’s Repulsorlifts</strong>, a landspeeder repair shop. He is suspicious of outsiders and believes that even honest customers are out to swindle him.</li>\n<li><strong>Salitt, Beggar:</strong> Male Neimoidian who begs on the streets of <strong>Zarra</strong>. He claims that he was once the Viceroy of the Trade Federation (he wasn’t) and seems distinctly deluded and paranoid.</li>\n<li><strong>Shass, Trader: </strong>Female Neimoidian, owner of <strong>Zarran Imports and Exports</strong>. A shrewd businesswoman, she had aspirations of rising through the ranks of the Trade Federation until the blockade of Naboo, when she refused to go any further in a corrupt organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Desson, Laborer:</strong> Male Neimoidian who works to rebuild <strong>Zarra</strong>. Desson seems like a man whose aspirations have been trod on for too long, such that now he is merely going through the motions.</li>\n<li><strong>Borlo, Imperial Informant:</strong> Male Neimoidian who earns his keep by feeding information to the Empire about any unusual happenings. He seems friendly and outgoing, but his eyes glisten with the promise of Imperial credits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KTzw2sOaWqPYAj0K]{Cato Neimoidian Citizen}</strong></p>\n<h2>A Visit from the Vipers</h2>\n<p>As the heroes arrive on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong>, they are hassled by a local swoop gang. The <strong>Vipers,</strong> a rough gang of thugs who terrorize <strong>Zarra</strong> on a daily basis, always look for fresh prey when an outlander starship arrives. The swoop gang’s leader is a violent Human woman named <strong>Kessra.</strong> She is the only female member of the gang, but she bears the scars of several past battles. From the <strong>Vipers’</strong> demeanor, it is clear that they follow her unquestioningly. However, they don’t realize that <strong>Kessra</strong> sometimes takes small jobs from <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. She uses her gang to achieve the crime lord’s goals in <strong>Zarra</strong>.</p>\n<p>As the heroes depart the spaceport where the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is docked, the <strong>Vipers</strong> ride in quickly and surround the party. <strong>Kessra</strong> taunts the heroes from the back of her swoop bike, claiming that they’ve failed to pay for a landing permit from the <strong>Vipers.</strong> If they wish to pass unharmed, they’ll have to dole out <strong>1,000 credits</strong> each. The heroes can pay the outlandish extortion fee, and if they do, <strong>Kessra</strong> pegs them as easy targets and leads the <strong>Vipers</strong> away—for now. But the whole time that the heroes stay in <strong>Zarra</strong>, gang members continue to shake them down for more money. They might even try <strong>attacking </strong>the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>if the heroes don’t eventually put up a fight, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is not pleased about having to drive off a gang of bikers.</p>\n<p>If the heroes refuse to pay the exorbitant amount that the <strong>Vipers</strong> demand, the swoop gang launches an <strong>attack</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Swoop Marauders</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: <strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[lf6mpWl6C4UXlNma]{2-01 Swoop Marauders}</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/kessra/kessra_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[T9pbtvnEabrgEbUE]{03 - Handout 3 - Kessra}</span></p>\n<h2>Locating Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>With nothing more to go on than a city and the name of a Hutt, the heroes don’t have many leads to follow. Asking questions about a Hutt crime lord can be a dangerous business in <strong>Zarra</strong>, and most citizens rebuff the heroes if they try. However, after a few attempts to find <strong>Darga</strong>, the heroes should come to realize that the Hutt lives in the city and is, in fact, well known, even if no one will reveal his exact location. But there is one way for the heroes to learn where <strong>Darga </strong>resides. One of his flunkies, a young Devaronian thief and errand boy named<strong> Warrick “Womp Rat” Raden</strong>, spends a great deal of time in the city. If the heroes can locate <strong>Raden</strong>, he can lead them directly to the Hutt’s secret <strong>palace</strong>. Below are some suggestions on how to handle the search for <strong>Raden</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Heroes who are trained in the <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) skill</strong> have an advantage in trying to find the Hutt. Though they cannot locate <strong><em>Darga</em> </strong>with the skill, they can find <strong>Raden</strong>, who takes pains to keep his movements low key (if not secret). A hero can use <strong>Intelligence (Investigation)</strong> to find him; the <strong>DC</strong> is <strong>25</strong> and the information costs <strong>500 credits</strong> in bribes. Success indicates that the heroes are told where to find <strong>Raden</strong>—a nearby ruined warehouse.</p>\n<p><strong>False Pretenses:</strong> The heroes might try to gain the attention of the Hutt and his associates through deception. This might include pretending to be a rival gang eager to start trouble or posing as fellow criminals looking to work with (or for) the Hutt. However, most citizens of <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> want nothing to do with the underworld, so if the heroes identify themselves as criminals of any kind, the residents shun them or refuse to do business with them.</p>\n<p>If the heroes spread rumors in an attempt to draw the Hutt’s interest, it takes <strong>two days</strong> before they see results. Provided that they didn’t spread rumors likely to provoke the crime lord (such as “<em><strong>We’re here to kill that slimy Hutt and take over this planet for our own!</strong></em>”), they receive an anonymous message telling them to meet <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> at the ruined warehouse at midnight. The message actually comes from one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>informants in <strong>Zarra</strong>, not from <strong>Raden</strong> himself, so the errand boy knows nothing of the heroes’ impending arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Bribery:</strong> No matter how much the citizens fear dealing with the criminal underworld, the right amount of credits can always open doors If the heroes visit traders, cantinas, spaceports, and even security offices searching for information on <strong>Darga</strong>, the right bribes can get them the information they need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>100 credits</strong> or less reveals no information regarding <strong>Darga</strong>, only that “<em><strong>some Hutt</strong></em>” has been terrorizing the people of <strong>Zarra</strong>.</li>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>101</strong> to <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes the name of the Hutt’s associate, <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, and lowers the <strong>DC</strong> on an<strong> Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> by <strong>10</strong> to locate the errand boy.</li>\n<li>A bribe of more than <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes not only <strong>Warrick Raden’s</strong> name but also the location of the abandoned warehouse where he can be found.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Threats and Violence: </strong>Though more in line with the Empire’s tactics, the heroes can use threats and violence to get information about <strong>Darga</strong>. Most of the population of <strong>Zarra </strong>is already cowed by the Hutt’s thugs and associates. Combined with occasional Imperial intervention, which never goes well even for law-abiding citizens, the locals have very little fight left in them.</p>\n<p>Using the <strong>Charisma (Intimidation) skill</strong> to intimidate citizens of <strong>Zarra </strong>only goes so far. A successfully intimidated citizen can say only that a Devaronian named <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> works for <strong>Darga </strong>and sometimes comes around to collect extortion money or deliver messages on the Hutt’s behalf. This information grants the same <strong>-10 DC bonus </strong>on <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> that bribery does.</p>\n<p>If the heroes use violence to find <strong>Darga</strong>, such as abusing local business owners or picking a fight in a cantina, they eventually get a message from one of the Hutt’s hidden agents who believes that the heroes are auditioning to join the organization. This message is identical to the one described under “<strong>False Pretenses</strong>,” above.</p>\n<p>However, violence does not sit well with the citizens of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and eventually one becomes scared enough to alert Imperial authorities to the heroes’ activities. An Imperial patrol consisting of <strong>six stormtroopers</strong> and an <strong>Imperial Junior Officer</strong> arrives on a transport skiff and attempts to take the heroes into custody. The Imperials call for reinforcements if the heroes resist arrest, and soon <strong>Zarra </strong>might be crawling with a large percentage of the Imperial forces on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, attracting attention the heroes do not want.</p>\n<p><strong>6 @Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{Stormtroopers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[56Fie9duL2tF66az]{Imperial Junior Officer}</strong></p>\n<h2>Finding Raden</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finally locate <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, they quickly discover that he does not want to be found or to talk about <strong>Darga</strong>. The Devaronian is willing to fight his way free and is not afraid to fire a few blaster bolts to put the heroes off his scent.</p>\n<h2>Darga's Cronies</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: <strong>@JournalEntry[p0XJ99N93haUpXn1]{2-02 Darga's Cronies}</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/warrick%20raden/warrick_raden_art.webp\" width=\"300\" height=\"594\" /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[lFfUtmlMoAzMT0Fs]{04 - Handout 4 - Warrick Raden}</strong></p>","folder":"DUb0crJ7IJjaqUGJ","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

During the Clone Wars, an orbital bombardment decimated the academy in the Cularin system, and if any artifacts have survived, common sense suggests that they have since been stolen. But the Force tells me that the holocron we require is there.</em></p>\n<p><em>I’ve never been to the planet Almas in person, but I knew the headmaster there, a serene Jedi Master named Lanius Qel-Bertuk. I have no current information on the planet, but I can provide you with coordinates and a path through the treacherous comet cloud that surrounds the Cularin system. These were obtained at great expense thanks to Senator Organa’s vast connections.</em></p>\n<p><em>I feel this is crucial to our cause, because I have sensed a link between the Sarlacc Project and the slaves that you rescued above Bespin. But I have probed the Force tirelessly and at last reached my limits. With this Jedi holocron, however, I might expand my ability to see through the Force and find the answers we seek. Furthermore, I will be able to pass on the lessons it contains to a future generation of Jedi, thus coming one step closer to restoring peace and justice to the galaxy.\"</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The coordinates to <strong>Cularin</strong> are programmed into the nav computer of the heroes' ship, which should be consulted for additional information about the system. If the heroes have more questions before the mission starts, you should clarify or repeat only what <strong>Master Denia</strong> already told them.

This dead zone is cold and lifeless, and full environment suits are required to survive in it. The area has grown steadily for <strong>centuries</strong> and now has reached the <strong>academy’s</strong> doorstep</p>\n<p><strong>DC15</strong> In the heart of the wasteland is an ancient <strong>Sith fortress</strong>, which was abandoned about a<strong> thousand years ago</strong>. The wasteland has grown at an estimated radius of <strong>3 feet per year</strong>, though the death of <strong>kaluthin</strong> was further accelerated recently, starting about <strong>13 years ago</strong> with sabotage by a <strong>dark side cult</strong> called the <strong>Believers.</strong> Since the razing of the <strong>Almas Academy</strong>, however, a radical surge in the dead zone has occurred. The wasteland now encompasses a radius of<strong> 3,100 miles</strong>, with a trail that leads straight to the ghost town of <strong>Forard.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>DC20</strong> It is rumored that the <strong>Sith Lord</strong> who built the <strong>fortress</strong> around <strong>1,150</strong> to <strong>1,400 years ago</strong> also created the <strong>kaluthin,</strong> combining his knowledge of bioengineering with the power of the <strong>Force.</strong> The <strong>kaluthin</strong> ability to synthesize the atmosphere of an entire planet is still considered an amazing achievement today. Until recently, scientists researched ways of transplanting the glowing grass to other worlds, but met with little success.</p>\n<h4>Intelligence (Lore)</h4>\n<p><strong>DC 10 Almas</strong> is the fourth and outermost planet in the <strong>Cularin</strong> system. Over a <strong>thousand years ago</strong>, a plant named <strong>kaluthin</strong> took root on the icy, lifeless world, nourishing itself from large underground lakes. Over time, the <strong>kaluthin</strong> synthesized the planet’s poisonous atmosphere (composed in large part of methane and phosphorus) into enough oxygen to sustain carbon-based life. Still, prolonged exposure can be hazardous to one's health due to trace amounts of toxins, and breath masks or atmospheric regulators are strongly recommended.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 15</strong> The local nights on <strong>Almas</strong> are not determined by the distant twin suns. Wherever <strong>kaluthin</strong> grow (everywhere except in the dead zone), their phosphorus-filled leaves absorb the moonlight and make the surface of the planet glow. It takes a while for newcomers to adjust to the dusk to dawn cycles, which are determined by the <strong>kaluthin’s</strong> leaves being either spread open or closed.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 20</strong> A century and a half ago, the <strong>Jedi</strong> established a training academy on <strong>Almas.</strong> The town of <strong>Forard</strong> was subsequently built, forming a circle around the <strong>Jedi academy.</strong> Several <strong>sadrin farms</strong> were found wherever <strong>kaluthin</strong> grew. All were recently abandoned, however, shortly after the <strong>academy</strong> was destroyed. Now the <strong>academy ruins</strong> and the surrounding town buildings are regularly despoiled by salvagers looking for valuable loot.</p>\n<p><strong>DC 25</strong> The <strong>academy</strong> was attacked at the end of the Clone Wars by three starships, which took the resident <strong>Jedi</strong> by surprise. One was a <strong>Cularin Allied</strong> Force ship that was brought down by <strong>Jedi starfighters</strong> and crashed into the <strong>academy</strong> grounds. Another was a mercenary vessel destroyed by allies of the <strong>Jedi.</strong> The third was a black starfighter that fled shortly after the assault, possibly carrying the party responsible for the attack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Read-Aloud Text</h3>\n<p>When the heroes exit hyperspace, read the following text aloud.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Several hours after leaving the Corellian Run, your starship exits hyperspace at the calculated point just outside the Cularin system.

This should be evident to the heroes based on the exchanges they overhear. Based on the droid’s reference to his relationship with <strong>Jedi Master Lanius</strong> (whom <strong>Master Denia</strong> mentioned to the heroes), they should realize that the droid might have information that can help them with their mission. If the heroes do not catch on immediately, feel free to offer them other incentives to recover the droid for themselves, such as having the droid mention knowledge of the <strong>academy’s ruins</strong> (“<em><strong>This never would have happened if I’d stayed in the ruins!</strong></em>”) and so forth. When the heroes approach, all parties react with a degree of restrained but visible hope, each trying to share its side of the story before the others.</p>\n<p><strong>SplrMuck,</strong> the unicellular <strong>Ugor</strong> holding the droid’s left arm, explains that his group found the droid first, fair and square, dragging it out from the <strong>Almas Academy</strong> ruins. <strong>SplrMuck</strong> set the droid down in front of the <strong>academy</strong> entrance for just a second when he saw the heroes’ ship set down nearby. <strong>SplrMuck’s</strong> story, if true, seems to be news to <strong>Jiminaldomabbramsti</strong> (or <strong>Jimi</strong>)—the feisty <strong>Squib</strong> with a death grip on the droid’s right arm—and his furry compatriots. They work for the <strong>Squib</strong> salvager <strong>Squeerie,</strong> and <strong>Jimi</strong> insists that no <strong>Ugors</strong> were around at the time he found this <strong>“treasure”</strong> near the temple entrance. Possession is nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine one-thousandths of <strong>High Squibbian Law</strong>, so if <strong>SplrMuck</strong> set the droid down, for whatever reason, it’s fair game. By contrast, <strong>Ugors</strong> have turned garbage gathering into a religion, and <strong>Ugorian Divine Law </strong>decrees that the first being to find a piece of junk consecrates it with his slime on contact, a mark of ownership instantly identifiable and respected by any other <strong>Ugor.</strong></p>\n<p>As for the half-droid himself, he explains respectfully that he is <strong>7-A39,</strong> or <strong>SevenAy,</strong> a former protocol droid for the <strong>Almas Academy.</strong> The heroes should not only feel inclined toward helping the hapless droid, but also recognize that <strong>SevenAy</strong> might have crucial information about the <strong>academy’s</strong> sublevels and perhaps the <strong>holocron</strong> they’re after.</p>\n<p>The heroes have multiple challenges in their interactions with the scavengers, but only acquiring <strong>SevenAy</strong> or a special <strong>datacron</strong> is critical to the success of their mission. The heroes must negotiate with the <strong>Squib</strong> and <strong>Ugor</strong> parties for the droid. The following challenges show how the heroes can affect the outcome of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: </strong>The heroes must either save <strong>7-A39</strong> so that they can question the protocol droid or obtain a <strong>datacron</strong> that will grant access to the computer inside the <strong>academy's</strong> control room. Although the scavengers begin the <strong>encounter hostile</strong> toward each other, each group begins with an attitude of <strong>indifferent</strong> toward the heroes, whom they hope can solve their dilemma. As both groups are really less interested in <strong>SevenAy</strong> than in getting as many credits as they can, they are receptive to any deal the heroes try to spin in exchange for the droid. If pressed, <strong>SplrMuck</strong> will give up his claim to <strong>SevenAy</strong> for <strong>2,000 credits,</strong> and <strong>Jimi</strong> will settle for any spare <em>breath masks</em> the heroes might have (the <strong>Squibs</strong> didn’t realize that the <strong>Almas</strong> atmosphere was technically poisonous). Once the heroes have acquired <strong>SevenAy,</strong> the <strong>Squibs</strong> throw in a <em>net,</em> free of charge, so that one of the heroes can carry the half-droid on his or her back.</p>\n<p>If the characters don’t barter for <strong>SevenAy,</strong> the <strong>datacron</strong> can be used instead to splice into the <strong>academy’s</strong> computer. However, the <strong>datacron</strong> won’t offer the same advice that <strong>SevenAy</strong> can. The droid has intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the <strong>academy,</strong> even after the attacks, and can provide directions and explanations of how some systems inside the <strong>academy</strong> work—for example, that the backup generator can power only one sublevel at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> In addition to obtaining components for their ship, the heroes can haggle with the scavengers for other items. The <strong>Squibs</strong> have the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a <em>battering ram</em></li>\n<li>a box of eight <em>glowrods</em></li>\n<li>a beat-up children’s <em>holobook</em> of <strong>Busteromuchmacho</strong> and the <strong>Vermillion Shadow</strong> (<strong>Vol. 3</strong> in the <strong>Squib Jedi</strong> series)</li>\n<li>a broken <em>lightsaber</em> that belonged to <strong>Dorv'Tilsta,</strong> the Padawan of Master Vhiin’Thorla, which will be of use to the heroes later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Ugors</strong> have these items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a clone trooper utility belt (with a <em>medpac</em> and 50 ft of <em>Fibercord</em> cable)</li>\n<li>a <em>Stokhli spray stick</em> (identifiable with a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>)</li>\n<li>a “<strong>holy holocron</strong>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the heroes show excitement over the <strong>holocron,</strong> the <strong>Ugors</strong> demand, in exchange, either a sizeable sum (<strong>5,000 credits</strong>) or something precious to the heroes. If the characters acquire the <strong>holocron,</strong> they quickly realize that it’s a <strong>“holocron”</strong> in name only—a cheap marketing ploy used to boost the appeal of everyday <strong>datacrons.</strong> If the <strong>Ugors</strong> allow the heroes to inspect the <strong>“holocron”</strong> before sealing the deal, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (technology) check</strong> reveals that it is fake.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> Finally, the heroes should try to resolve the scavengers’ dispute peacefully, a successful <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check </strong>results in apologies from both sides for the misunderstanding. Give the players <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they attempt to get the <strong>Squib</strong> and <strong>Ugor</strong> parties to understand each other’s <strong>sacred laws</strong>.

When the heroes dine, some other guests at the <strong>main table</strong> include <strong>Morrax Nabin,</strong> Imperial governor <strong>(major guest); Lynaa,</strong> famed fashion designer <strong>(major guest); Cednah Faenel,</strong> Alderaanian noblewoman <strong>(major guest);</strong> Capt. <strong>Z’paul Diin,</strong> Dr. <strong>Hakaen Bousch,</strong> and <strong>Ruf-Asti-Viarffli.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The challenge for the heroes is to make civilized conversation while enjoying the finest foods from across the galaxy—and without looking like they just fell off a spice freighter from Tatooine. To make a good impression, the heroes need to participate meaningfully in the conversation as many times as possible, up to a maximum of <strong>six.</strong></p>\n<p>Three unsuccessful attempts to participate—whether unsophisticated (“<em><strong>Yummy!</strong></em>”) or uninformed (“<em><strong>Of course nerf come from Bespin!</strong></em>”)—result in the heroes’ opinions not being taken seriously for the remainder of the meal, effectively ending the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Conversation:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. On a success, they engage their dining partners in casual conversation unrelated to the meal but charming nonetheless. Empty banter grows tiresome, however, so add <strong>+3</strong> to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt by any of the heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Oenology:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong>, allowing players to add their <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> if they are proficient in <strong>brewer's kits.</strong> On a success, they make insightful observations about the wine, remarking on its vintage and character.

On a failure, the other guests become incredulous at their “<strong>facts</strong>,” making this option unavailable to any hero for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>FoodNet Addict:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. On a success, all that time spent browsing the HoloNet pays off, and they recall reading or watching something about a given dish. A failure makes this option unavailable to them for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking a Peek: </strong>If a player is <strong>force</strong> sensitive, have them make a <strong>DC 20 universal force-casting check.</strong> On a success, they glimpse some detail about a dish’s origin, perhaps a brief vision about how it was prepared.

Three massive statues surround it, depicting ancient martyred heroes of the <strong>Nazren.</strong> The Empire has set up <strong>three defensive turrets</strong> between the statues. An <strong>AT-ST</strong> patrols the <strong>120-foot-wide</strong> empty circle around the dome and statues. If there are any other forces here, they support the <strong>AT-ST.</strong></p>\n<p>The <strong>AT-ST</strong> is a major foe for the heroes, and this battle is one of the centerpieces of the adventure. The heroes might be able to defeat the walker through sheer firepower, but they can also attempt to take control of a <strong>turret</strong> or topple a giant statue onto the <strong>AT-ST.</strong> If the heroes come up with another workable plan for dealing with the walker, feel free to run with it. Beating the machine that has terrified the <strong>Nazren</strong> for months should be the heroes’ greatest moment of glory to date.</p>\n<h4>Read-Aloud Text</h4>\n<p>Read the following text as soon as the heroes can see the plaza.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Martyr’s Plaza is a picture of dichotomy. The ornate central stone dome is covered in scrollwork and decorative bas reliefs of Nazren history. A hatch sits atop the dome, its thick metal etched with golden colors. Standing around the dome are three 50 feet-tall statues. Each depicts a Nazren in robes, arms extended and face tilted up to the sky. Though the statues are noble and moving, they are also centuries old. Each shows signs of wear from the elements, and their bases are cracked and worn away. One of the statues leans slightly, and the others don’t seem securely set in their mountings.</em></p>\n<p><em>Marring this peaceful and holy place are the ugly scars of Imperial occupation. Three armored turrets sit between the statues, blasters tracking the outer rim of the plaza. Walking in patrol around the dome is an All-Terrain Scout Transport, a massive war machine armed with twin blaster cannons and a grenade launcher. The walker seems undamaged and is alert for possible trouble.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Each <strong>turret</strong> is located between two of the three statues. As a result, each one has line of sight to only a third of the battlefield, and the turrets cannot target each other.

If a hero has cover, the walker isn’t shy about using its <strong>stomp</strong> to <strong>attack</strong> an area or firing all weapons at the cover in attempt to destroy it. The walker tries to ensure that no one swarms over and takes control of a turret as it could be a major threat to it.</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the <strong>AT-ST,</strong> they can open the hatch in the stone dome and descend into the underground control center. The <strong>six Imperial technicians</strong> inside the station surrender. They realize that they have no chance against any force able to defeat a walker. On the other hand, if you want to run another encounter in the control center, have the Imperial technicians resist the intruders, use the <strong>'Stormtrooper'</strong> statblock from '<strong>Collateral Damage</strong>' for these technicians.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>Once the heroes and their <strong>Nazren</strong> allies take over the <strong>control center,</strong> they are in charge of all communication on the planet. They can cut off Imperial communications planetwide, and they begin to hear reports of <strong>Nazren</strong> defeating <strong>stormtroopers</strong> throughout the city.</p>\n<p>In addition, the <strong>Nazren</strong> now control the <strong>rogue tracking station.</strong> The Empire will have to deal with rogue fragments if they wish to land on <strong>Nizon</strong> from space, greatly increasing the difficulty of an Imperial mission to retake the planet.</p>\n<p>The <strong>control center</strong> is also able to track the <strong>crab droids</strong> that have been harassing the heroes by tracing their signal back to its origin. If a hero thinks to try this, it requires a <strong>DC 16 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes also detect a message from an Imperial officer to <strong>Vril Vrakth,</strong> who is stationed on <strong>Mount Antas.</strong> It instructs him to wait for any remaining officers within the city, then destroy the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> database and evacuate the planet. <strong>Vrakth</strong> acknowledges the order but doesn’t promise to obey it. If the heroes contact <strong>Vrakth,</strong> he offers to leave the database intact but taunts them by suggesting that they come talk to him about it in person. <strong>Vrakth</strong> isn’t done with his hunt just yet.</p>\n<p>If <strong>Sartok</strong> accompanied the heroes into the <strong>control center,</strong> he asks to remain there so that he can coordinate revolts planetwide.

{"_id":"khWwKFzsngjcvZv3","name":"Part 2: Bait and Chase","content":"<h1>Part 2: Bait and Chase</h1>\n<p>Despite the trouble the heroes have caused in the <strong>Invisible Hand,</strong> no authorities are forthcoming in the depths of the <strong>Gnawer’s Roost.</strong> The fighting is by no means unusual. As long as none of the locals, such as <strong>Klef</strong> or <strong>Tekkur,</strong> have been undeservedly harmed in the fighting, the residents won’t bat an eye at the heroes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the heroes will find that any calls they make to the <strong>loyalist safehouse</strong> following the fight go unanswered. This should raise alarms in their heads, especially if they are in need of information or medical attention. Though they might find some use in remaining in <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> for a while (whether it’s to ask questions or do some other investigations), their real concern should be to ensure that their <strong>loyalist</strong> friends at the <strong>safehouse</strong> are all right.</p>\n<h2>Safehouse of the Dead</h2>\n<p>The return to the <strong>safehouse</strong> is remarkably uneventful. Another taxi (or even the same one, depending on how the trip into the <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> ended) can be hired to transport the heroes, or they can make other arrangements. Strangely enough, Imperial <strong>checkpoints</strong> are positioned so as to keep citizens from entering the more dangerous portions of the city, especially since criminals and other miscreants can descend into the bowels of <strong>Coruscant</strong> and lose themselves there.</p>\n<p>The quiet is perhaps the most disconcerting thing about the trip. The heroes’ ears are still ringing from their last shootout, and nothing feels quite right. Every set of eyes that glances their way is suspect; every siren or alarm might be a result of their passing. Even more than before, there should be a sense of tension and paranoia in the air.</p>\n<p>From outside, the tenement block that contains the <strong>safehouse</strong> apartments looks the same as when the heroes left for the <strong>Gnawer’s Roost.</strong> <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive heroes have a distinct feeling that they are being watched, even though nothing is visible. Entering the building is just as uneventful, whether the heroes take a turbolift or climb one of the two narrow stairwells that lead up to the <strong>safehouse</strong> floor.</p>\n<p>Once they arrive on the tenement’s <strong>third floor,</strong> they know that something is definitely wrong. The ozone-sweet smell of <strong>blaster fire</strong> lingers in the air, along with a thin, smoky haze. The walls of the hallway are scorched and burned in some areas, and a dark substance—fresh blood—stains the carpet. Entering the safehouse through any one of the three doors (all of which are open), the heroes are greeted with the macabre sight of their <strong>loyalist</strong> hosts, dead.</p>\n<p>Some of the <strong>loyalists</strong> obviously went down fighting, <em>blasters</em> held tightly in their stiffening fingers. It looks like a number of others were rounded up after the fact, put against a wall, and executed in a flurry of <strong>blaster fire.</strong> Despite their best efforts, the heroes find no survivors— everyone they met during their stay in the <strong>safehouse</strong> is dead.</p>\n<p>The heroes probably seek to raid the <strong>safehouse’s</strong> supplies, which have not been taken or tampered with. But they won’t have much time to rummage around. Once they discover the dead and search the entirety of the <strong>safehouse</strong> for survivors, allow them to attempt <strong>DC 25 Wisdom (Perception) checks</strong>. Success indicates that they hear the sounds of stealthy movement out in the hallway.</p>\n<p>The <strong>tactical team</strong> that was sent to wipe out the loyalist contingent has been waiting in an upstairs apartment for signs that they missed someone. They have been monitoring life signals and motion using a bank of portable scanners, which have revealed the heroes’ arrival and movements.</p>\n<p>When the heroes appear to be occupied with supplying themselves, or when they seem to be leaving the premises, the tactical team moves into position and attempts to wipe them out. They <strong>attack</strong> from opposite sides of the building and take no <strong>prisoners.</strong></p>\n<p>In the event that the heroes venture upstairs to search for enemies, the <strong>tactical team</strong> sets an ambush, waiting for them to clear the turbolift or stairs before opening fire.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[B6Vy5S2Qn6hgMlOO]{7-04 Safehouse of the Dead}</p>\n<h2>Where Giants Tread</h2>\n<p>Make it clear that the heroes are wanted more than ever before. <strong>Coruscant</strong> is no longer safe, and their faces, if not their names, are known to the authorities. The seat of the Empire is the last place they want to be. The heroes might be tempted to flee to the undercity (especially if they have cultivated allies there due to their actions in the <strong>Gnawer’s Roost),</strong> but that merely forestalls the inevitable Imperial advance into that part of the city.</p>\n<p>Of course, getting off <strong>Coruscant</strong> won’t be a walk in the park. The planet crawls with Imperial troops, and every one of them is looking for the heroes. They should expect a difficult time of things, and tensions ought to be high, but the trip to the starport where their ship is located is easier than expected—suspiciously so, in fact.</p>\n<p>When they arrive at the starport, they find it a ghost town until they see the Imperials waiting for them, a prototype <strong>AT-AT.</strong> This prototype has been sent to stop the heroes from leaving <strong>Coruscant.</strong> The overwhelming force is meant to discourage the heroes from trying to leave in their own ship. The Empire doesn’t give them credit for being foolish enough to face the challenge head-on.</p>\n<p>If the heroes show their faces brazenly, the <strong>AT-AT</strong> immediately fires at them. Though the <strong>AT-AT</strong> crew has been instructed take out the heroes, they haven’t been authorized to destroy the terminal building. However, if the heroes become a nuisance or prove capable of posing a threat to the <strong>AT-AT,</strong> these orders will be ignored.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[LVH5KMYy03gABhKt]{7-05 Where Giants Tread}</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge:</strong> The goal of this encounter is escape. The heroes must neutralize or bypass the enemies in the starport so they can enter their ship and leave for safer pastures. One option is to run headlong into the fray, relying on their own skill to keep them alive against overwhelming odds. They also might consider going in quietly, attempting to sneak to their ship without being seen.</p>\n<p>Both options have merit, but the quiet route is liable to be difficult considering that the tarmac is a wide open, empty space with only a few starships to provide cover. If the heroes took the missile launcher with its enhanced missile from the safehouse, they might try to take the <strong>AT-AT</strong> out.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> Even if the heroes manage to escape, they might be suspicious because the Empire had access to their ship for an undetermined amount of time. They are quite right to be concerned—the Empire’s technicians have been busy in a number of nefarious ways.</p>\n<p>The first problem is a large <em>detonite charge</em> attached to the reactor of their starship. The charge is hidden well by Imperial standards; it requires a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> to locate and a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) </strong>to disarm. The bomb is linked to the ship’s hyperdrive and detonates only if the heroes engage light speed. The resulting explosion will destroy the ship, kill the heroes, and prematurely end the adventure.</p>\n<p>If the heroes roll poorly or don’t think to look for evidence of foul play, give them a few ominous hints, such as “<em><strong>Who knows how long the Empire had access to your ship?</strong></em>” or “<em><strong>A number of access panels around the ship seem to be out of place.</strong></em>” You can also mention that there seem to be a large number of odd fluctuations as the heroes enter the hyperspace coordinates into the navigation computer.</p>\n<p>The bomb should not be a death sentence for unlucky heroes. It’s designed to show that they are considered a huge threat by their enemies; they ought to be flattered.</p>\n<p>In addition to the <em>detonite charge,</em> the Imperials placed three <em>tracking devices</em> throughout the ship. In case the heroes manage to recover their ship, disarm the bomb, and escape from <strong>Coruscant,</strong> the Empire wants to be able to track them down and finish the job. Two tracking devices are in relatively obvious locations, with little effort made to conceal them; they require <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> to find. The third tracking device is hidden more carefully, deep within the recesses of the life support system; it requires a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> to find.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note: </strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Escaping aboard the player's ship while discovering and disarming the Imperial devices should be considered a level up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"bHivDRZGzX0rT8lY","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

If they defeated her but left her alive, she follows the heroes to <strong>Darga’s palace</strong> to exact her revenge upon them. During their audience with the <strong>Hutt,</strong> she hid and observed them from a distance, and at some point she decides to whittle them down a few at a time. Late one night, one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>servants (a <strong>Neimoidian </strong>who seems afraid of everything) visits the rooms of one or two heroes who are particularly charismatic or who had some kind of special interaction with <strong>Kessra</strong> during the swoop gang encounter. The servant tells the heroes that <strong>Darga </strong>has summoned them to a secret meeting in his <strong>aviary</strong> because he cannot trust anyone else with what he has to say. As far as the <strong>Neimoidian </strong>knows, this is correct.

Taxis are the most common, though most taxi pilots charge a hazardous route fee if asked to descend into the <strong>Gnawer’s Roost.</strong> Unless you have other plans (see Auxiliary Challenge, below), the drive into the slums is uneventful.</p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> It is possible to keep the heroes on their toes by mentioning the presence of law enforcement units in the area as they proceed to their destination. Alternatively, you can confront them with a security <strong>checkpoint</strong> manned by Imperial <strong>stormtroopers.</strong> Such <strong>checkpoints</strong> are common on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> and it takes a combination of careful navigation and street smarts to avoid having to pass through one.</p>\n<p>The majority of the taxi pilots who the heroes might hire are lawabiding citizens who are largely <strong>indifferent.</strong> Such pilots find it suspicious if the heroes request that they avoid Imperial checkpoints. If the pilot’s attitude remains <strong>indifferent,</strong> he attempts to avoid <strong>checkpoints,</strong> but this doubles his fee. If the heroes can improve the pilot’s attitude, he makes an effort to avoid <strong>checkpoints</strong> but won’t do anything overt to get himself into trouble. If the players have a <strong>helpful</strong> pilot they do anything to help the heroes out, including running through a <strong>checkpoint.</strong></p>\n<p>Conversely, a pilot who has been annoyed stops his taxi and demands that the heroes get out.

Imperial law enforcement has no presence in <strong>Gnawer’s Roost,</strong> and the only rule is that might makes right. While in the area, the heroes might be approached by any number of seedy characters looking to make a deal or score a few credits. Parties who are obviously armed or combat capable are left alone.</p>\n<p>The <strong>flophouse</strong> is inside a grimy permacrete structure with a flickering holographic display out front that advertises hourly rates. Seven tough-looking youths, each sporting similar garb and colors, loiter outside the hotel, hungrily eying anyone who passes. Like the rest of the locale’s denizens, they do not accost anyone who appears to be wellarmed. Heroes who maintain a nonthreatening or benign countenance are verbally abused in the hopes that they will display some weakness.

Anyone peering behind the counter sees that the droid, designated <strong>0T-3PO,</strong> is actually chained to the floor to prevent its theft, its escape, or both.</p>\n<p>When the heroes enter the flophouse, read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The interior of the flophouse’s lobby is no cleaner or promising than its exterior. Every surface seems filthy, from the torn chairs leaning up against the grimy walls to the thin metal counter covered in flimsy paper, old garbage, and empty food packets. Behind the counter stands a 3PO droid, his gray exterior patched with rust and corrosion. One of his eyes glows dully in the lobby’s dim light, while the other is dark and unseeing. “Ah, hello,” the droid pipes up in forced cordiality as you enter. “How may I be of assistance?”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>0T-3PO</strong> has worked as the desk clerk in this <strong>flophouse</strong> for so long, he’s practically a fixture. In his time behind the counter, he’s seen a great many things, and his behavioral inhibitors have slowly eroded as a result. Though he rarely wishes for freedom— the outside world is a frightening place—he is somewhat annoyed by the fact that he is chained to the floor. “<em><strong>It’s not as if I would wander off. Doesn’t anyone trust me?</strong></em>” he often asks himself.</p>\n<p>The answer, of course, is “<strong><em>No.</em></strong>” 0T-3PO is incredibly untrustworthy and would sell out anyone for a few paltry credits. It isn’t precisely his fault; he can’t help himself. He is merely a product of his environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>The <strong>3PO</strong> unit gladly tells the heroes where to find <strong>Pavel Trenol’s</strong> room—for a price. Much of the droid’s behavioral programming has been modified or removed, an unhappy result of existing in such a wicked part of <strong>Coruscant.</strong> The droid answers initial inquiries in an official tone, stating, “<em><strong>The requested information is confidential, as per the clause of our establishment’s rental agreement. However, for a small fee, payable in standard credits, the clause can be waived.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>Heroes can pay a bribe of <strong>1,000 credits</strong> for the information, or they can attempt a <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Persuasion) check</strong> to improve the droid’s attitude or intimidate him into revealing what they want to know. Heroes can also access the hotel’s computer to determine the location of <strong>Trenol’s</strong> room: unit <strong>5212,</strong> five floors down. The <strong>fifth sublevel</strong> is accessible by a rickety <strong>turbolift</strong> or a perpetually moist and gloomy stairwell.</p>\n<p>Room <strong>5212’s</strong> door is constructed of thin alloy and covered in a peeling wood veneer. Using the chime or knocking at the door results in no answer. Heroes who succeed at a <strong>DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>can hear what sounds like a holovid unit playing. Forcing the door requires a key (available from <strong>0T-3PO</strong> for an additional fee of <strong>1,000 credits</strong>), a <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (security kit) check</strong> to bypass the lock, or a<strong> DC 20 Strength check </strong>to break down the door.</p>\n<p>Inside is a poorly furnished hotel room about <strong>15 feet square</strong>, with fraying carpet, peeling wallpaper, and an adjoining refresher that smells of mildew. A single holovid unit blares out the latest Podrace results in a combination of Huttese and Basic. The bed, sagging from age and long use, is empty. A quick search reveals that no one is present. A hero who makes a successful <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>finds a scrap of flimsy paper on top of the holovid unit, upon which is written “<em><strong>Invisible Hand.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge:</strong> Obviously, the challenge here is for the heroes to find <strong>Trenol.</strong> The scrap of paper is a clue, but it will mean little to the heroes unless they can find someone who knows specifically what it refers to. Any hero who succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Lore) check </strong>learns that the <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> was the name of <strong>General</strong> <strong>Grievous’s </strong>flagship during the Clone Wars, and that the vessel was destroyed during the Battle of Coruscant.</p>\n<p>If the heroes return to the hotel lobby, they can press the <strong>3PO</strong> unit for information concerning <strong>Trenol’s</strong> whereabouts. The droid doesn’t know where <strong>Trenol</strong> is, only that he left hours ago in the company of several rough-looking Quarren. The droid attempts to milk this information for all the credits he can get, offering nothing unless specifically asked. If the heroes ask about the <strong>Invisible Hand,</strong> he responds: “<em><strong>I believe the Invisible Hand is a cantina. For a small fee, I can provide you with directions.</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>The droid is not the only individual with knowledge of the <strong>Invisible Hand’s</strong> location. The gangsters outside can be helpful with directions or information if they are properly motivated. Unlike the droid, however, the street gangsters don’t know <strong>Trenol</strong> and haven’t seen him or his Quarren companions.</p>\n<h2>Ogre Ambush</h2>\n<p>As the players travel from the flophouse to the <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> cantina, they are assaulted by a group of <strong>eight Coruscani ogres</strong> that are out scavenging for food. The <strong>ogres</strong> lie in wait for passing prey, emerging from the shadows in small groups and attacking en masse. Though they prefer their prey to be alive, they have no compunctions about dealing killing blows to foes that offer resistance. The screams of their victims are typically ignored by the neighborhood’s residents.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[Ouurcc9ke3zCKLpj]{7-02 Ogre Ambush}</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If the heroes wipe out the <strong>Coruscani ogres,</strong> they’ve inadvertently performed a good deed on behalf of the citizens of <strong>Gnawer’s Roost.</strong> Witnesses to the scuffle spread word of the heroes’ deeds, furthering their reputations and, in many cases, their personal standing within the community. Though this won’t result in any monetary compensation, it goes a long way toward ingratiating the heroes with the locals. Residents of <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> who know of the heroes’ role in the <strong>ogre pack’s</strong> destruction are automatically <strong>friendly</strong> with the players.</p>\n<p>Though <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> is a haven of inequity, the citizens still feel a certain amount of gratitude toward people who have helped them in some way. Nearly every resident of the neighborhood knows of someone who was purportedly killed by a <strong>Coruscani ogre,</strong> and it is assumed that anyone who vanishes in <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> has been abducted and subsequently eaten by the creatures.</p>\n<h2>The Invisible Hand Cantina</h2>\n<p>Named after the flagship of the late <strong>General Grievous,</strong> the <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> is a seedy cantina that caters to ex-Separatists and political dissidents. Though not overtly political, the clientele consists of bitter and disenfranchised individuals who were on the losing side of the Clone Wars (or who want others to think that they were). In <strong>Gnawer’s Roost,</strong> the cantina has a mixed reputation. On one hand, the regulars are mostly seen as losers who are attempting to relive their bygone days of glory. Conversely, many of the downtrodden residents of the surrounding slums view ex-Separatists as anti-establishment heroes.</p>\n<p>From the outside, the <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> appears to be little more than a run-down tenement. The only indication that the cantina exists is a hexagonal sign in flickering blue neon, reminiscent of the Confederacy’s emblem. A set of steep stairs, slippery with moldy dampness, leads down to the cantina’s entrance. A single Quarren bouncer named <strong>Tekkur</strong> stands guard at the door. He keeps an eye out for trouble, but he won’t do anything to dissuade the heroes from entering the cantina.</p>\n<p>The interior of the <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> is dim and clouded by a mixture of smoke and bitter Quarren incense. The air is thick and pungent, laced with a multitude of aromas—not all of them legal. The walls are hung with flags, old Separatist recruitment posters, and war memorabilia. Pieces of alloy, which knowledgeable characters can identify as parts of a ship’s hull, are hung here and there with reverence. These are purportedly fragments of the original <strong>Invisible Hand</strong> that fell to the ground when the ship crashed during the Battle of Coruscant.</p>\n<p>The cantina is sparsely populated. Aside from the bouncer at the door, there is a Gran bartender, <strong>Klef,</strong> serving two Trandoshan laborers at the bar, and a group of four Quarren toughs in the company of a single Human male near the rear of the establishment. The heroes likely assume that the Human is <strong>Pavel Trenol,</strong> and they are partly correct. The man appears to be the same one detailed in the hologram that <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> sent with his transmission, but his real name isn’t <strong>Pavel Trenol;</strong> it’s <strong>Tavik Moern.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tavik Moern</strong> is a deep cover operative with the Imperial Security Bureau. His normal duties include monitoring dissident groups in parts of the planet that are best avoided by uniformed agents. He is currently assigned to ensure that the heroes don’t leave <strong>Gnawer’s Roost</strong> alive. To this end, he has brought along several other agents to aid him who are currently disguised as Quarrens through holograms.</p>\n<p><strong>Tavik Moern</strong> feigns innocence at first. Heroes who examine him or the Quarren in an attempt to sense deception must succeed at a <strong>DC 24 Wisdom (Perception) check </strong>to discover the deception.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Challenge: </strong>The obvious challenge here is for the heroes to defeat their enemies and survive. Capturing <strong>Tavik Moern</strong> and exposing his true nature should bring the heroes to the conclusion that something is terribly wrong. Apparently, <strong>Varth’s</strong> information was faulty. This might cause the heroes to wonder if <strong>Varth</strong> himself (or someone else in their organization) is untrustworthy. If questioned directly about <strong>Admiral Varth,</strong> <strong>Moern</strong> spits and calls him a traitor to the Empire.</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[95KdgsNf5ngjJ3Vp]{7-03 The Invisible Hand}</p>","folder":"bHivDRZGzX0rT8lY","sort":300000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Group attitude worsens by one step (from <strong>indifferent</strong> to <strong>unfriendly,</strong> for example).</p>\n<p>A hero can attempt any of these social interactions by making the listed <strong>skill check</strong>:</p>\n<p><strong>Witty Banter:</strong> The hero engages one or more guests in conversation on any number of topics. Have the player make a <strong>DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. A failure results in the hero making an off-putting or ill-mannered remark.</p>\n<p><strong>Attentive Listener:</strong> Careful observation and active listening help the hero pick up on important details and appear sympathetic and understanding. Have the player make a <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A failure results in the hero losing focus and completely misunderstanding the speaker’s point.</p>\n<p><strong>Innuendo:</strong> The hero engages in a more subtle type of conversation, one in which what is left unsaid is most important. Have the player make a <strong>DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A failure means that the hero misinterpreted another guest’s meaning or accidentally implied something embarrassing.</p>\n<p><strong>Blend In:</strong> The hero tries to blend in to the crowd to avoid drawing attention. Have the player make a <strong>DC 21 Dexterity (Stealth) check</strong>. A failure means that other guests notice the hero’s shyness, perhaps mistaking it for aloofness.</p>\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>The result of this reception sets the tone for the remainder of the <strong>social encounters</strong> on the <strong><em>Gem of Alderaan</em></strong>.

Use their descriptions to decide which option is closest to their intent, calling for the appropriate <strong>skill checks</strong>.</p>\n<p>If your players have trouble coming up with an approach to these sorts of encounters, particularly at the beginning, be ready to list each option along with its associated<strong> skill check</strong>, but don’t tell the players the specific <strong>DCs</strong> right away. As the adventure progresses, though, you should find the players adapting to these encounters, perhaps even suggesting the use of skills that aren’t listed.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternative Skills:</strong> Each noncombat encounter lists several skills that can be used to gain the desired outcome, but this list is not necessarily exhaustive or exclusive. If a player suggests another relevant skill that might be useful in the situation and provides a reasonable explanation of how to apply it, give that player the benefit of the doubt and let him make the attempt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[gec5gvhpF9KEjCYk]{03 - Handout 2 - Noncombat Encounters}</p>\n<h2>All Aboard</h2>\n<p>As the reception draws to a close, <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> appears to welcome the guests and invite everyone on board the<em><strong> Gem of Alderaan</strong></em>.

While the guests file onto the massive repulsortrain, Lady Aldrete is hurried on board by her staff, bypassing everyone else in line.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Once on board, give the heroes a little time to explore. The repulsortrain is much shorter than it would be during regular service because this is an invitation-only maiden voyage, only a <strong>few hours</strong> long. From front to back, the <em><strong>Gem of Alderaan</strong></em> includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>control car</strong>, where the <strong>crew control</strong> the operation of the repulsortrain. For safety reasons, this area is sealed off from <strong>passengers.</strong></li>\n<li>A <strong>lounge car</strong>, featuring all-around windows that provide a breathtaking panoramic view. The lounge is broken down into <strong>semiprivate areas</strong> for small gatherings, and available amenities include an extensive library, a fine selection of spirits, and even atmospheric bubbles for guests to adjust the environment to match their comforts (and to keep <strong>t’bac</strong> and <strong>spice</strong> odors away from others).</li>\n<li>A <strong>dining car</strong>, seating dozens in a <strong>split-level dining area</strong> that includes smaller, <strong>two-person</strong> tables for couples, <strong>four-to six-person tables </strong>for small groups, and a <strong>single</strong> large <strong>banquet table</strong> for large gatherings. Underneath the upper level are the kitchens, fully automated with state-of-the-art luxury autochefs and taking up far less room than such a stunning gourmet kitchen would normally require. The top level also includes a bar and another Mon Calamari water sculpture, this fountain somewhat smaller and less ornate than the one at the reception.</li>\n<li>A <strong>casino car</strong> that includes four <strong>sabacc</strong> tables, <strong>three Savareen whist dealers</strong>, <strong>two jubilee wheel tables</strong>, and <strong>two large banks of credit game machines</strong> on the trailing balcony. In addition, the casino has a <strong>stage</strong> for various entertainment, <strong>two bars (one on each level)</strong>, and a heavily armored,<strong> secure cashier’s area</strong> dominating one side of the car.</li>\n<li>A car dedicated to <strong>Lady Aldrete’s</strong> personal <strong>nightclub, <em>Decadence.</em></strong> It is kept dark except for pulsing strobe lights and dim table lamps, and the <strong>dance floor</strong> noticeably vibrates from the pounding, relentless beat of high-tempo music. The lower level has a bar, several booths, the dance floor, a main stage, and two smaller <strong>dance stages</strong> with a floor-to-ceiling bronzium pole. The upper level has small tables, booths, a bar, a single <strong>sabacc table,</strong> and a small <strong>manager’s suite</strong> that overlooks the <strong>dance floor.</strong> Unlike the other cars, this one has a <strong>bouncer</strong> at the entrance who turns away anyone not deemed <strong>important</strong> (or <strong>attractive)</strong> enough to come inside.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Traveling in Style</h2>\n<p>Give the heroes some time to explore the train as a whole before starting the different <strong>social encounters</strong> outlined below.

{"_id":"nAmgdXVYtXsBpWDW","name":"Part 3: Imperial Prison Facility","content":"<h1>Part 3: Imperial Prison Facility</h1>\n<p>Once the heroes have concluded their visit to the <strong>Felucian village</strong> (and prevented the Imperials from reporting its location), they can make their way to the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. Their <strong>Felucian scout</strong> leads them around obstacles and potential threats and takes them directly to the facility. Their guide doesn’t say much on the journey — and unless the heroes have a translating droid, they won’t understand him, anyway — and simply leads them to their target with solemn determination.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive, they discover that the <strong>prison facility</strong> is a relatively squat, two-story building in characteristic Imperial style: gray walls with a slight outward slant, no visible windows, and a plain visage that leaves no room for accouterments. The second story of the building is visibly smaller than the ground floor, and blinking lights line the top floor’s edges. A large set of blast doors denotes the ground floor entry to the building, while a single gun turret (which appears to be an assault cannon built into the wall) juts out a <strong>few meters </strong>to the door’s left. Otherwise, there are no other visible entrances or exits to the facility.</p>\n<p><strong>Stormtroopers </strong>stand guard at the facility’s blast doors, while the low hum of speeder engines indicates that there might be <strong>scout troopers</strong> on patrol nearby. Additionally, any hero who succeeds on a <strong>DC 15 Perception check</strong> hears heavy thudding sounds in the distance, along with the noises of plants being crushed, indicating the presence of a walker of some kind.</p>\n<p>Fortunately for the heroes, their <strong>Felucian scout</strong> is aware of a secret entrance. He leads them to the northwest corner of the building, where a ventilation grate barely hangs on its bolts. With the right application of force (dealing at least <strong>10 points of damage</strong> to the grate), it can be pried free, giving the heroes a way into the <strong>prison facility</strong>.</p>\n<p>Within the facility, the heroes will find that everything follows the typical Imperial style, with standard metal walls (<strong>DR 10</strong>, <strong>150 hp</strong>) and metal doors (<strong>DR 10</strong>, <strong>50 hp</strong>). Additionally, the facility has a central computer system with a <strong>Slicing</strong> <strong>DC </strong>of <strong>20 </strong>without the correct code cylinder. All of the doors in the facility’s interior are unlocked by default. However, the exterior blast doors are sealed from the inside. From the outside, the doors can be opened only by slicing the computer (using the terminal and scomp link that provides access to the computer).</p>\n<p>An overall map of the first floor appears below. Each detailed encounter in the facility also has its own map.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/scenes/backgrounds/Prison%201st%20Floor.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"463\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>That Was Too Easy</strong></p>\n<p>After entering and making their way through the facility, some heroes may wonder how a secret prison for political malcontents could be infiltrated by novices so easily. In truth, the entire rescue of Admiral Varth is a setup designed to lure the heroes into complacency and get them to accept the Admiral into their confidences. Varth is merely pretending to be a traitor. He and Inquisitor Draco are the only two people who know the truth of the ploy. All other members of the Empire, including the Imperials stationed at the prison facility, believe that the Admiral really is a traitor. This level of deception was necessary to ensure that someone as resourceful as Bail Organa didn’t find out about the ruse somehow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>P1: Medical Bay</h2>\n<p>Originally a standard medical bay intended to heal prisoners who were injured during interrogations, the bay has been transformed into a science lab for the slightly demented <strong>Captain Vischera</strong>. The room is littered with experimental equipment designed to alter the genetic material of the <strong>captain’s </strong>test subjects—namely, the <strong>Felucians </strong>that the Empire has been snatching from the nearby villages. Three filled bacta tanks line the far wall. Currently, the tanks are empty of patients, but wear and scratches on the inside of each tank show that whatever had been floating within had tried to claw its way out.</p>\n<p>A former Imperial scientist and now the head of the<strong> prison facility</strong>, <strong>Captain Vischera </strong>has been altering the genetic code of <strong>Felucians </strong>to create mutant warriors. When the Confederacy collapsed, many Separatist secrets fell into the hands of the Empire, among them a few that <strong>Captain Vischera</strong> found most intriguing. Particularly of interest were experiments performed by the Techno Union on the natives of the planet <strong>Nelvaan</strong>, transforming them into massive, violent warriors that could be bent to their creator’s will.</p>\n<p>After months of experimentation, <strong>Vischera </strong>has managed to create two such monsters out of Felucian<strong> </strong>hosts, at the cost of many lives. Additionally, a small number of <strong>Felucians </strong>that were part of the evolutionary process still remain alive, and they are kept here for further observation.</p>\n<p>When the heroes arrive in this room, they must fight the mutated <strong>Felucians </strong>and the medical attendant.

Though most of the equipment is far too large to carry away, the experiments include a set of <em>healing stimulants </em>that <strong>Vischera </strong>has been using to stabilize his monstrous creations. There are <em>10 active samples</em> of <em>stimulants</em>, each loaded into an injector and ready for use. The <em>stimulants </em>are used as a part of a short rest, and each stimulant used allows the recipient to use one additional <strong>hit die</strong> to heal until the next <strong>long rest</strong>. However, when a <em>stimulant </em>is used, the recipient receives one level of <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.EpnBWP4VKrmHICaa]{Exhaustion}</strong>. The stimulants allow for additional healing, but they put a great deal of strain on the body when active.</p>\n<p>@Item[PfHnPliCxc8VNpz8]{Healing Stimulant}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Foundry Note: </strong>The <strong>exhaustion</strong> effect is also included in the item description for the Healing Stimulant.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>P2: Defense Turret</h2>\n<p>Unaware of the damaged ventilation hatch the heroes used to enter the facility, the Empire focuses most of its defenses on frontal assaults. A modified <strong>assault cannon </strong>has been mounted into the wall of this area, pointing outward, and an <strong>Imperial gunner</strong> mans the turret at all times. Additionally, a small number of other personnel remain on duty in the area to assist with spotting enemies and, when necessary, defending the turret from the inside. A turret gunner manning the assault cannon always has <strong>three-quarter cover</strong> from targets outside the <strong>prison facility</strong>, and all other targets in the area have <strong>total cover</strong> and concealment from the outside. The <strong>assault cannon</strong> can be removed from the wall as an action, though this also decouples the <strong>assault cannon</strong> from its tripod and power source, which provides it with unlimited ammunition.</p>\n<p>If the heroes do not take care to be quiet, or if a fight breaks out elsewhere on the ground floor of the facility, the Imperial personnel in this area will investigate the disturbance. However, most of the doors in the facility block sound relatively well, and as such any combat that takes place behind closed doors usually will not alert the Imperials in the defense turret.

Originally, the <strong>prison facility</strong> was a communications station before it was converted into a holding area for political prisoners. As such, a large portion of this room features advanced communications equipment. However, <strong>Felucia </strong>is a backwater planet, so there is usually little going on to justify any kind of largescale activity, though the communications center does coordinate with the <strong>Victory-class Star Destroyer </strong>in orbit.</p>\n<p>See “<strong>Communications Center</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.

The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//ROUTED...SECURITY ENCRYPTION CONFIRMED</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//FROM PRAKITH CITADEL COMM CENTER VIA HOLONET NODE 6673-ALPHA</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//FROM NODE 6673-ALPHA VIA STAR DESTROYER ASSIDUOUS</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Priority 1 Message Follows:</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">Prepare former Admiral Gilder Varth for transfer to the Citadel.

Varth will be transferred by shuttle to the Assiduous before Inquisitor Draco takes custody. Time from administration of interrogation chemicals to transfer to the Inquisitor’s personal transport should fall within an acceptable window of 27 to 54 minutes.</p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">//END TRANSMISSION</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\"> </p>\n<p style=\"font-style:italic\">@JournalEntry[d2oGkhzriIorbFif]{04 Handout 4 - High-Priority Message}</p>\n<p><strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> sent the message to make sure that everyone in the facility believes that <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is a traitor to the Empire. Only <strong>Varth </strong>and <strong>Draco </strong>know the truth of the deception.</p>\n<h2>P4: Prison Block</h2>\n<p>The small <strong>prison block</strong> where <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is being held is unlike most Imperial detention centers. Instead of having individual holding cells, the <strong>prison block</strong> features an open but secure area where the <strong>prisoners </strong>share a living space. However, the space is filthy and the <strong>prisoners </strong>are treated poorly, and a former Imperial <strong>Admiral </strong>is no exception. Unlike the other locations in the facility, the <strong>prison block</strong> is closely monitored. As soon as the heroes enter the room, they find themselves under attack from the guards, who have orders to shoot first and ask questions later.</p>\n<p>See “<strong>Detention Block F-1A</strong>” for more information on running this encounter.</p>\n<h2>Detention Block F-1A</h2>\n<p>@JournalEntry[0X6rPJuhLbHF0DbX]{1-09 Detention Block F-1A}</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is a slightly overweight man with close-cropped gray hair and a bushy mustache. He has clearly seen better days; his right eye is swollen and bruised, and a trail of dried blood stains the corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>If the heroes manage to free <strong>Varth</strong>, he is grateful but confused as to the identity of his rescuers. He expected to be freed by <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> staff, not by hired freelancers. However, he is willing to accept whatever stories the heroes tell him as long as they promise to get him out of the facility. <strong>Varth </strong>is eager to take the ruse to the next stage and pass on so-called vital secrets that will lure <strong>Organa </strong>and his agents into a trap.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is fairly guarded about the specifics of his imprisonment. Unsure of who the heroes are, he doesn’t want to reveal too much, but he confirms that he is a former Imperial Admiral who has been funneling information to “<em><strong>interested third parties</strong></em>” for some time now. He says that he was captured a short while ago and is being held at the Felucian <strong>prison facility </strong>until the proper Imperial authorities can arrive to retrieve him.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth </strong>agrees to help the heroes escape from the facility, but he’s not terribly interested in helping them fight. He can give them advice, but he is reluctant to pick up a blaster, even in his own defense. If pressed, he lends his aid, but in combat he usually provides the heroes with tactical assistance rather than shooting at anyone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/gilder%20varth/gilder_varth_art.webp\" width=\"450\" height=\"624\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[wDYAhgEkfXU65oaw]{05 - Handout 5 - Gilder Varth}</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Admiral Gilder Varth}</strong></p>\n<h2>Can't Get Out That Way!</h2>\n<p>When the heroes have retrieved <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>(and possibly planted the explosives in the communications center), they likely make their way back to the ventilation grate they used to enter the facility. However, two developments threaten their plans. First, they come upon a disturbing sight—just outside the grate, a large number of <strong>@Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{stormtroopers} </strong>stand around the crumpled body of their <strong>Felucian guide</strong>, and an <strong>@Actor[LLxezY3EqvHI9H7r]{AT-ST}</strong> stomps around the exterior of the facility. Second, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends a message over the heroes’ comlinks — the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is operational again, and they can leave the planet whenever they are ready. If the heroes don’t remember the second floor of the facility (which they should have seen from the outside), <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> mentions that some of the Imperials he dealt with mentioned the presence of a command center on the second floor. He suggests that they make their way up there and attempt to reach the roof. From there, they can call <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> for a pickup and avoid the Imperial presence outside.</p>\n<h2>Turbolift Cluster</h2>\n<p>This cluster of four standard turbolifts ferries troops and officers between the two floors of the <strong>prison facility</strong>. Unlike the rest of the computers in the facility, the computers that operate the turbolifts are hostile to anyone without a particular code cylinder—specifically, the one possessed by <strong>Lieutenant Aden</strong>. If the heroes have retrieved Aden’s code cylinder, they can insert it in a port inside the turbolift, making the control computers helpful and gaining access to the command center on the second floor.</p>\n<h2>P5: Command Center - CR 4</h2>\n<p>When the players take the turbolift, move on to: @JournalEntry[7rtcUeciWoVQHGCf]{1-10 Command Center}</p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finally make their way to the roof of the facility with <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> brings the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>swooping in to rescue them. As laser fire spatters ineffectually against the ship’s shields, the heroes can climb into the transport via the extended landing ramp. If the heroes planted the explosives in the communications center, the first round of explosions begin tearing through the facility, growing louder and closer with each passing second. Once everyone is on board,<strong> Captain Okeefe</strong> blasts off, and within moments the ship is safely away from the lush fungal world.</p>\n<p>However, the <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>that grounded the players to is still in orbit and has been attempting to scout the planet with <strong>TIE/LN squadrons </strong>to find them, a small squadron of <strong>TIE/LN fighters </strong>is in range to fire on the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> in an attempt to stop them from completing their rescue mission.</p>\n<p>This encounter serves as an entry-level space battle for players to gain their first <strong>deployment rank</strong>. It shouldn't serve as a roadblock to the players but rather serve as a space battle tutorial. The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is too far away to assist its fighters and the <strong>TIE's</strong> should be relatively easy to destroy for the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The heroes should also be in a position to get into any deployment they desire. The <strong>Banshee</strong> has the <strong>Coordinator</strong>, <strong>2 Gunner</strong>, <strong>Mechanic</strong>, <strong>Operator</strong> and <strong>Pilot </strong>deployments though it is likely Captain Okeefe fills the <strong>Pilot</strong> deployment with Crash filling any spare role. Feel free to have <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> knocked out or otherwise indisposed from the opening barrage if a player wishes to pilot the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>If the players wish to escape the battle rather than fight it out, they can plot a hyperspace course out of the combat using the '<strong>Astrogation Time Taken</strong>' table in <strong>Chapter 8</strong> of <em>Starships of the Galaxy</em>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>After the encounter with the <strong>TIE/LN Starfighters </strong>is concluded <strong>Captain OKeefe</strong> tells the heroes that she has been instructed to rendezvous with a starship in the remote and uninhabited <strong>Zandrax System</strong>. She goes out of her way not to mention <strong>Bail Organa’s</strong> name, especially not in front of <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, and explains that their benefactor has set up a refuge for them. Upon exiting hyperspace, the heroes are greeted with the impressive vision of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, a brand-new Nebulon-B frigate that will serve as a mobile safe house for the <strong>Admiral</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> lands the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>in one of the <em><strong>Resurgence’s </strong></em>docking bays, and once they disembark, they meet the captain of the frigate, <strong>Adrian Verana</strong>. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> is a tall and slender man with jet-black hair and a finely trimmed beard that hugs his square jaw. He is dressed in the sterile uniform of an Alderaanian officer, and his dark eyes seem to weigh each hero carefully as he speaks to them. Captain Verana tells the heroes that they have been assigned quarters on the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, and that the ship’s facilities (including the medical bay) are available at any time. Moreover, the agreed-upon credits have been transferred into their bank accounts, and they are free to confirm the transaction on terminals in their quarters.</p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth i</strong>s escorted away by several Alderaanian Security agents, who look at the former Imperial with a mix of suspicion and interest. Once <strong>Varth</strong> is gone, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> tells the heroes that <strong>Senator Organa</strong> is thankful for their assistance and forever grateful that they went to such risks to aid him. If the heroes are willing, Verana offers them permanent quarters aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>in exchange for their assistance in the near future. Depending on the results of <strong>Varth’s </strong>debriefing, Verana believes that the Senator might have further need of clandestine agents to act on his behalf. He urges the heroes to keep as quiet as possible about the Senator’s involvement. Even though <strong>Varth </strong>has been communicating with <strong>Organa</strong> on a regular basis, now that they have taken overt action against the Empire, they do not wish to incriminate the Senator in any way.</p>\n<p>If the heroes mention the message regarding Inquisitor <strong>Draco's </strong>visit to <strong>Felucia</strong>, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> becomes troubled and mutters that they might have uncovered something far more involved than a simple Imperial traitor. An Imperial Inquisitor should be a significant concern for any Jedi or <strong>Force</strong>-using characters as well—the chief concern of the Inquisitorius is hunting down, capturing, and killing <strong>Force</strong>-sensitive beings of all stripes.</p>\n<h2>Next Adventure: A Wretched Hive</h2>\n<p>A Wretched Hive, the next adventure in the Dawn of Defiance campaign, will take the heroes to the planet <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, where they encounter a Hutt crime lord and are drawn into his world of vice and violence. Not only will the heroes need to ingratiate themselves with the vile gangster <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>, but they will also discover new secrets about Imperial projects and meet a <strong>Jedi Master</strong> who will play an integral role in the unfolding campaign.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> finishing the adventure</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

Underground Park","content":"<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Underground Park</h2>\n<p>All water on <strong>Almas</strong> is underground, so the <strong>academy’s Jedi</strong> custodians reasoned that building an <strong>underground park</strong> with a running stream would be in tune with the will of the <strong>Force.</strong> The stream was discovered while digging the <strong>academy</strong> foundations. Instead of diverting it, the <strong>Jedi</strong> requested that the architects integrate the stream into the design—it was they who had intruded on the water’s natural course, after all. The <strong>Jedi</strong> then planted local trees and <strong>kaluthin</strong> and created a garden around the stream. Occasionally, they took blind <strong>coboko</strong> fish out of the pond that formed in the park center, adding them to the <strong>academy</strong> menu.</p>\n<p>Of course, all the <strong>park</strong> vegetation is now dead, blackened by the intense presence of the <strong>dark side</strong>. The park also contains several bodies of <strong>Believers</strong> who managed to find the secret stairwell in the <strong>library</strong> and turned viciously on one another after encountering the <strong>t’salak.</strong> At the center of the room, beside the pool, is a large pump used to force water to the levels above. It looks like it hasn’t functioned in a long time. The heroes don’t have much time to admire the scenery, however. When they reach the park center, read the following text:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>You walk into the impressive chamber, crossing a bridge than runs over a clear and soothing stream.

Solid walls seem to have materialized out of nowhere and separated all of you, at the same time blocking the entrance from which you came. You feel a deep sense of dread when a cruel figure from your past appears right in front of you—someone you never imagined you would see again. You look around for a way out, but your feet don’t respond. You try to cry out, but the attempt yields no sound. As if in slow motion, the heartless figure prepares to attack.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This encounter is similar to <strong>Luke’s</strong> experience inside the cave on <strong>Dagobah.</strong> Each hero finds him- or herself face to face with his or her worst nightmare. The heroes are caught in a combination of a <strong>mind trick</strong> (which makes them believe that they cannot walk away or speak out) and a <strong>Force illusion</strong> (which makes them believe that they are facing an old enemy).</p>\n<p>For each hero, choose a character or creature that poses a threat and has some significance to that hero. It could be an enemy, living or dead, from a previous adventure or even from the current adventure. It could also be someone from the hero’s past (for instance, an unlikable former employer or a cruel family member). Determine the appropriate encounter for each hero in advance, without worrying about statistics.</p>\n<p>The effects of the <strong>dark side nexus</strong> permeating this place, in combination with the influence of the <strong>t’salak</strong> (which feeds on the heroes’ feelings of hate and fear), create this <strong>Force illusion</strong>. Heroes who make a successful <strong>DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check</strong> realize that their enemy is an illusion, but this knowledge does not dispel the illusion. The twist is that behind each <strong>“illusion”</strong> hides one of the other heroes. The trap is designed to cause the heroes to fight each other unknowingly.</p>\n<p>Prior to the adventure, ask the players for their character sheets, and record their most important scores (<strong>weapon damage dice</strong>, <strong>attack bonuses</strong> and types, defenses, hit points, <strong>Initiative</strong> and skills, and so on). Then, when each hero faces an illusion, describe what weapons or items the opponent carries—in other words, the weapons or items used by the other hero. There is no need for an illusion to wield the same exact weapon as the hero behind it, but the weapon should resemble something in the same class (such as a vibrosword, blaster, lightsaber, and so on).</p>\n<p>If the number of heroes is uneven, one of the heroes is met by a crazed <strong>Believer</strong> instead of by another hero (for statistics, see <strong>“Crazed Believers,”).</strong> In this case, the Believer hides behind the illusion of a friend, such as <strong>Senator Organa, Master Denia</strong>, or even one of the other heroes.</p>\n<p>Explain to the heroes that they are all inexplicably isolated from one another. Ask for <strong>initiative</strong> rolls, and record the results beside each hero’s name. As soon as an <strong>attack</strong> occurs, use a player who is opposite them as a target. If the <strong>attack</strong> hits and <strong>damage</strong> is dealt, record the number. Pretend that the next <strong>initiative</strong> turn belongs to the opponent of the hero just <strong>attacked,</strong> describe the <strong>attack,</strong> and reveal the <strong>damage</strong> dealt. If one hero is fighting a <strong>Believer,</strong> this fight can be incorporated with the others in order of <strong>initiative</strong> but treated as regular combat.</p>\n<p>Allow each character a <strong>DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong> at the beginning of their turn to realize that something is not right. Success indicates that the hero can tell that what he sees before him is not real, though it looks as if it could become real at any moment. If a matched pair of heroes goes for <strong>3 consecutive rounds</strong> without <strong>attacking</strong> each other, the entire illusion is dispelled for the whole group, and the angry <strong>t’salak</strong> <strong>attacks.</strong></p>\n<h3>Encounter Example</h3>\n<p>Here’s an example of how this encounter could be run. Assume that the party contains five heroes, so four of the heroes fight each other, while the fifth fights a <strong>Believer.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vor’en</strong> the soldier <strong>(Init 20)</strong> versus <strong>Arani</strong> the noble <strong>(Init 14)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Kelko</strong> the scout <strong>(Init 16)</strong> versus <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> the Jedi <strong>(Init 28)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Deel</strong> the scoundrel <strong>(Init 24)</strong> versus a <strong>Believer (Init</strong> <strong>8</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Round 1</h4>\n<p><strong>Sia-Lan</strong> is up first, and she‘s face to face with <strong>Count Dooku.</strong> But <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> makes her <strong>Perception check</strong> and knows that <strong>Dooku</strong> is dead, so she realizes that the <strong>encounter</strong> must be a trick. She decides<strong> not to attack.</strong></p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Deel</strong> finds himself facing one of his friends, <strong>Kelko,</strong> who runs madly toward him. <strong>Deel</strong> asks him what is going on, but his voice is mysteriously soundless. He fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and doesn’t realize that it's a trick.</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Vor’en</strong> fails his <strong>Perception check</strong> and thinks that he’s run into a <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> He pulls out a blaster and fires at the enemy, striking <strong>Arani</strong> and dealing <strong>8 points </strong>of <strong>energy</strong> <strong>damage.</strong> (From <strong>Arani’s</strong> perspective, she’s shot by an old friend, who wields a hold-out blaster that she gave him long ago.)</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Kelko</strong> (who also failed his <strong>Perception check</strong>) takes out his two vibrodaggers to <strong>attack</strong> a green, tentacled alien that he once encountered on <strong>Zlarbv IV.</strong> He slashes at it, dealing <strong>12 points</strong> of <strong>kinetic damage</strong> to <strong>Sia-Lan.</strong> (From <strong>Sia-Lan’s</strong> perspective, <strong>Count Dooku</strong> <strong>attacks</strong> her with two lightsabers. The <strong>Jedi</strong> doesn’t understand what’s happening—she was sure that the appearance of <strong>Dooku</strong> was some kind of trick!)</p>\n<p>Next, <strong>Arani</strong> succeeds on her <strong>Perception check</strong> and tries to convince the phantom that she is no threat, but he doesn’t seem to hear her. She has to defend herself, so she pulls out her own blaster and shoots him, dealing <strong>12 points of energy damage.</strong> (From Vor’en’s perspective, he’s shot by the <strong>stormtrooper.)</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, the <strong>Believer</strong> acts, rushing <strong>Deel</strong> and pummeling him to the ground, dealing <strong>15 points of kinetic damage.</strong> (From <strong>Deel’s</strong> perspective, he’s being <strong>attacked</strong> by his friend <strong>Kelko.</strong> Has he gone crazy? Regardless, <strong>Deel</strong> decides that he must defend himself.)</p>\n<h4>Round 2</h4>\n<p><strong>Sia-Lan</strong> can’t believe it. <strong>Count Dooku</strong> just <strong>attacked</strong> and nearly killed her. Maybe <strong>“Dooku”</strong> is a clone, a doppelganger, or something else, but whatever it is, <strong>Sia-Lan</strong> was hurt for real and must defend herself. She ignites her lightsaber, preparing to <strong>attack</strong> <strong>Kelko</strong> . . .</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Oozing Madness</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[TG0FnH71xQazat8R]{4-05 Oozing Madness}</strong></p>","folder":"Wpb39C25RhEZiJOa","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"oDE6URs9iAzFB11z","name":"Introduction","content":"<p><em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em> is the seventh adventure in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, which will take heroes from <strong>1st level</strong> all the way through <strong>20th level</strong> in a continuous storyline designed to give both players and Gamemasters a complete <em><strong>SW5e</strong></em> experience. In this adventure, the heroes are in hiding on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> wanted by the Empire for their recent actions against the Inquisitorius (as detailed in the previous adventure,<em><strong> The Core of Corruption</strong></em>). When the heroes are sent to find a <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> designer who survived the destruction of the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong>, they learn—the hard way—that the Empire does not like to be crossed. The heroes should advance to <strong>15th level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Update</h2>\n<p><em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em> begins mere <strong>days</strong> after the end of the previous adventure, <em><strong>The Core of Corruption</strong></em>. The heroes remain on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> safely entrenched with the <strong>loyalists</strong> in their <strong>safehouse.</strong> The details of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> are now in the hands of <strong>Captain Verana</strong> aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence,</strong></em> and the loyalists are trying to decide what to do next.</p>\n<p>The heroes haven’t had much time to get comfortable. The majority of the <strong>loyalists</strong> are normal folks who do not agree with the <strong>Emperor’s</strong> politics and have decided to do something about it. They aren’t trained combatants, for the most part, though one or two of the <strong>loyalist</strong> guards might have some experience in law enforcement (as local police, bounty hunters, or the like).</p>\n<p>Tensions in the <strong>safehouse</strong> are high, especially now that the heroes— who are wanted by the Empire—are here. Every caller that comes to the door is examined, and every speeder that passes by on the street is suspect. Despite the worry, the <strong>loyalist</strong> hosts are congenial and, in some cases, fawn over the heroes. After all, the heroes are nearly legendary due to their prior exploits, and they’ve recently stood up to the Inquisitorius and walked away victorious.</p>\n<p>This is a good opportunity for roleplaying between the heroes and the people who look up to them. Allow the heroes to make friends, share meals, and form friendships with the <strong>loyalists.</strong> Demonstrate that these people are good and represent everything that the Empire stands against. Give the heroes a reason to care. Later, when the <strong>loyalists</strong> meet their fate, it will make their deaths more meaningful and reinforce the true evil of their enemies.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p><em><strong>A Reckoning of Wraiths</strong></em> opens in the <strong>loyalist safehouse</strong> on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> where the heroes wait for the heat from their recent activities against the Inquisitorius to cool down. Within a <strong>day</strong> of their arrival at the <strong>safehouse,</strong> <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> contacts them via a pirated Holonet signal. Against the odds, one of the captive <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> designers, an Incom weapons technician named <strong>Pavel Trenol,</strong> survived the destruction of the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong>. Seeking asylum, <strong>Trenol</strong> contacted the <strong>loyalists.</strong> He is currently laying low in a hotel in <strong>Coruscant’s</strong> <strong>lower levels</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> instructs the heroes to contact <strong>Trenol</strong> at his hotel and provides them with a poor-quality holo of the technician. They venture into <strong>Coruscant’s</strong> seedy underbelly, encountering some of its most bestial denizens. When they arrive at the hotel, the heroes find only an empty room registered in the technician’s name. Brief investigations lead them to a cantina, where they are ambushed by <strong>Imperial Security Bureau agents</strong>.</p>\n<p>With nothing more to go on, the heroes return to the <strong>safehouse.</strong> But while they were gone, Imperial troops descended on the hideout and killed or captured the <strong>loyalists.</strong> The troops also try to put an end to the heroes, who retreat to the landing pad where their ship is located. Unfortunately, it has been impounded and is guarded by an <strong>AT-AT</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes escape <strong>Coruscant,</strong> they are best served by returning to the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> at the appointed rendezvous. But when they emerge from hyperspace, they find the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> under attack by a large Imperial force. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> calls for help, leading the heroes to dock with the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>—which has been boarded by <strong>stormtroopers</strong>—to rescue as many crew as they can. But they can do little when they discover that <strong>Inquisitor Valin Draco</strong> has captured <strong>Jedi</strong> <strong>Master Denia</strong>.</p>\n<p>Once off the <em><strong>Resurgence,</strong></em> the heroes are contacted by <strong>Admiral Varth,</strong> who is again in full Imperial regalia. He only pretended to defect in an attempt to root out insurgents and now demands that the heroes surrender. Instead, the heroes jump into hyperspace and find their way back to <strong>Senator Organa.</strong></p>\n<h2>Encounters</h2>\n<p>The encounters \"<strong>@JournalEntry[Ouurcc9ke3zCKLpj]{Ogre Ambush}</strong>\" and \"<strong>@JournalEntry[zdWBH24DkKjzYub8]{A Line of Prisoners}</strong>\" can be used in the order presented. However, if you want to mix things up a bit, these encounters can occur in any order within their chapters.

Right now, it is occupied by <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> and four of his associates, all engineers working at the <strong>Imperial Testing Grounds</strong> on the <strong>Outer Moon.</strong> Two are <strong>Incom</strong> subcontractors and two work for <strong>Subpro,</strong> but the important thing is that they’re all engineers, not technicians. They know a good bit about designing starships, but less about flying them— and, quite obviously, not near enough about fixing them.</p>\n<p>Heroes who dock with the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> learn this and more. Only <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> a chirpy, upbeat Duros, has much spaceflight experience, although the heroes realize pretty quickly that whatever is wrong with the ship is over his bald green head—particularly since he’s left his toolkit on <strong>Prakith.</strong> It takes a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong> to get the ship running again in short order.</p>\n<p>If the heroes glance around while they are working on the ship or afterward, they spy one of the engineers working at a console. The console displays a ship design with which the heroes are utterly unfamiliar; it resembles a forced marriage of a large <strong>Z-95 Headhunter</strong> and an <strong>ARC-170</strong>. If the heroes ask <strong>Seejo</strong> about the ship, he begins chattering about a <strong>Deep Scout</strong> design that <strong>Subpro</strong> and <strong>Incom</strong> are jointly developing on the <strong>Outer Moon</strong> of <strong>Prakith</strong>—until one of the other engineers reminds the chatty <strong>Duros</strong> that secret does actually mean secret. “<em><strong>You’re hanging by a thread as it is, Seej.</strong></em>” Blushing—in his case, picking up a slightly bluer hue of green—Jekk coughs and chuckles.</p>\n<p>Receiving a message from his employers, <strong>Jekk</strong> makes his apologies and escorts the heroes to the airlock with their ship. “<em><strong>If you’re ever in Prak City, look me up,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>I do a lot of thinking at the Mother Lode Cantina. Maybe we can talk hyperspace theory sometime—and, um, you can tell me again how you got that thingie back there to do what you got it to do.</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Jekk Seejo</h2>\n<p>As an <strong>Incom</strong> employee, <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> frequently let his enthusiasm for all things spaceworthy get out of hand. Fancying himself an amateur explorer and test pilot but without the training for either, <strong>Seejo</strong> often wheedled his coworkers into using his ship, an old clunker left over from the Clone Wars, as a guinea pig for their more outlandish concepts. By the time of the Empire, with <strong>COMPNOR</strong> beginning to purge aliens from the ranks of major defense firms, <strong>Seejo</strong> was reduced to the role of a subcontractor, finding work only when his friends in the engineering community brought him in. His happy manner frequently brings his fellow engineers along for the ride, even against their better judgments.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Prak City</h2>\n<p>Read the following aloud as the heroes enter <strong>Prakith’s</strong> atmosphere and approach <strong>Prak City:</strong></p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>If the Empire were looking for a more forbidding world to exploit, it could hardly have selected a better one than Prakith. A planet of tortured ridges, jagged canyons, and sandy gullies, Prakith could give Utapau and Tatooine a run for their money in the contest for the galaxy’s most desperately bleak world.</em></p>\n<p><em>From the air, you see the rugged Magraddor Range far to the west and, nestled within, the towering obsidian spire of the Citadel Inquisitorius.

Ironically, this part of <strong>Prak City</strong> predates the Empire; the plateau made for a good location for mining prospectors to place their encampments. The miners are still there, but so are all the construction firms the Empire has brought in. The firms are actively taking down parts of the old city to put up a new one in its place—a city which, many of the residents in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> realize, they will not be welcome in. Their increasingly ghettoized community is an active part of its own destruction.</p>\n<p>Destruction of brain cells is the major leisure-time activity here, and inquiries will direct the heroes to a shrine devoted to the act: the <strong>Mother Lode Cantina.</strong> Managed by a female Bothan who gets left alone because she knows where all the skeletons are buried on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the <strong>Cantina</strong> is host to a wider range of individuals than would ever be allowed to congregate anywhere else on <strong>Prakith.</strong> There are construction workers and miners here, Human and alien both, with the latter complaining of increasing harassment by <strong>COMPNOR.</strong></p>\n<p>The cantina’s real mother lode is information. Depending on who the heroes talk to, they can learn quite a lot.</p>\n<h3>Construction Workers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Environmental practices here are not particularly sound. The Empire is literally drilling holes in the giant mesa and dumping its construction debris and trash into them.</li>\n<li>Most of the workers who built the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> have been cycled off <strong>Prakith</strong> by their employers—on purpose, most suspect.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Citadel</strong> has entry points at its base and a small landing platform at its top, used by <strong>Inquisitors</strong> going to and returning from <strong>Prak City</strong>.</li>\n<li>Part of why the <strong>Citadel</strong> went up so fast is that they found a clearing in the mountains that was perfectly flat and sound enough for a foundation. Who cleared it, they don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miners</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are four major mining operations in the vicinity of <strong>Prak City</strong>. The <strong>Asonel</strong> system is the largest, with multiple mining operations; it is to the <strong>north</strong> and <strong>northwest.</strong> To the <strong>west</strong> and <strong>southwest</strong> are more modest operations: the <strong>Geddis, Herkeath,</strong> and <strong>Rilkean</strong> mines.</li>\n<li>Gems are the most lucrative resource miners get from <strong>Prakith’s</strong> crust; in some places, they’re plentiful enough to be picked from the cave wall by hand. Of course, someone still must do the work.</li>\n<li>Cave-ins have plagued a lot of mines, making employees for these operations hard to come by. It shouldn’t be too hard for itinerant laborers such as the heroes to sign on with a mining operation. Curiously, at least one, the <strong>Geddis</strong> operation, is looking for hired muscle as well as miners.</li>\n<li>To the knowledge of the miners here, none of the cavern systems entered by the major mining operations interconnect, and none comes anywhere near the Magraddor Range (where the <strong>Citadel</strong> is).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aliens</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are stepping up the pressure on construction and mining firms to get rid of their non-Human employees.</li>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents in <strong>Prak City</strong> itself have recently begun hassling aliens physically, with the Empire turning a blind eye.</li>\n<li>It’s rumored that <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are literally getting away with murder—a lot of <strong>“undesirables”</strong> have been disappearing altogether.</li>\n<li>There might be a native non-Human population on <strong>Prakith.</strong> Unusual characters have been seen from time to time, but they dash away as quickly as they’re spotted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whoever the heroes talk to, they should hear that the best source of information might be the guy who’s been on <strong>Prakith</strong> the longest, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong>. A former miner (and the founder of the Geddis mine), <strong>Geddis</strong> is drinking his life away in the back room. He knows a lot, but heroes are warned that his liver and mind are in equally poor shape these days.</p>\n<h3>Old Man Geddis</h3>\n<p>They call him the <strong>Old Man,</strong> and one look at him shows why: <strong>Myrum Geddis</strong> looks like he’s spent much of his <strong>70 years</strong> either lifting rocks or drilling into them. He probably looked this way at <strong>30.</strong> But swilling his drink at a table in the back, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> gives no impression of having been in a mine—or having engaged in any kind of work—in the past <strong>year.</strong> His days are spent nattering about the phantom creatures he’s seen in the catacombs, and drowning his sorrows. And he has a few: As the heroes can learn by offering <strong>Geddis</strong> a drink or two, the mine that bears his name is no longer his:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is Geddis mine a rich claim? </strong>“<em>You betcha it is—though it’s tougher’n anythin’ to get the gems outta there. You gotta be real careful not to hit ‘em with the laser-borer too much or you’ll ruin the lot. It’s fine work—y’need organics for that.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why couldn’t you make a go of the claim?</strong> “<em>I coulda! But I couldn’t afford to hire all the hands I needed t’really get at the good gem veins. And then them Impies come along, givin’ favors t’the Thaarke Corporation. Blast ‘em all!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s wrong with the Thaarke Corporation?</strong> “<em>They’re scum! Claim-jumpers—and that’s not all. Criminals, the lot of them. And they use slaves when they can find ‘em!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What makes you think there were creatures living underground?</strong> “I<em> seen ‘em! At th’ end of a tunnel—I could barely make ‘em out, but they was movin’. Looked for all my years like hairless Wookiees, if y’ask me.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are they looking for more miners out there?</strong> “<em>Ye’d help them, even after drinkin’ with me? Pfah! But they’ve taken every lowlife that don’t know how t’tell a gem from a dirtball. I guess they’d take ya.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discussion, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> sinks into a drunken stupor. Further inquiries about the <strong>Thaarke Corporation</strong> can be made within the cantina. Most people believe that the firm is a better and more productive steward than <strong>Geddis</strong> was; at least, plenty of gems are coming out now. <strong>Thaarke</strong> is hiring miners and security-types for the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine, and if the heroes are interested, they can visit the recruiting post in the morning. “<em><strong>Just don’t say that Old Man Geddis sent you!</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Seejo Again</h2>\n<p>Emerging from the cantina after dark, the heroes head up the alley and spy something rolling their way—a metal barrel, bounding down the lane. The can crashes against the side of a building, and a familiar yelp emanates from within the barrel. The lid pops off to reveal none other than <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> dizzy and bruised. Regaining his bearings, <strong>Seejo</strong> recognizes the heroes. He’s pleased to see them, but fearful of the half-dozen figures coming down the hill. They’re <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents, devoted to purging non-Human influences from the Empire. “<em><strong>You drunks stand aside,</strong></em>” the first one yells. “<em><strong>This isn’t your affair!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> panicking, seems to think that it is. “<em><strong>Don’t let them have me!</strong></em>” When the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to port, he lost his job, his ship, and, ultimately, any protection he had against <strong>COMPNOR.</strong> They no longer want him on <strong>Prakith,</strong> and he fears that they won’t bother deporting him. The agents were rolling him somewhere when the barrel got away. “<em><strong>They’re going to throw me down the Drains,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>Help me!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>The <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents eye the heroes suspiciously, especially if there are any non-Humans within the group. “Get in our way, will you? Well, you can share what’s coming to the skinbag here!” See the encounter “<strong>Saving Seejo.</strong>”</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[BFBCdysXeUt8VHUz]{9-01 Saving Seejo}</p>\n<p>Down here in the alley after dark, there’s a good chance that a brawl will go unnoticed; the Empire rather expects <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters to start a lot of the fights themselves. Bystanders disappear into the nearby buildings quickly. <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters will quickly try to flee once the player seem to be winning up the stairs on foot, running down a side alley or into the cantina as a last resort. They do not flee to the south, where one of the <strong>Drains</strong> is, fearing that might give an attacker ideas.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes deal with the <strong>guard champions</strong>, they will need to make haste in their departure. Though the government of <strong>Prakith</strong> expects trouble from the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters, they will not take the deaths of <strong>four</strong> <strong>guard champions</strong> lightly. However, the Empire’s response will likely be slow, since the local government expects the <strong>guard champions</strong> to be able to handle themselves and therefore will not have reinforcements nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> nearly in a panic, directs the heroes to a stinking pit near the construction site. This is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> tubes drilled from the <strong>Prak City</strong> plateau into a recess deep underground; the Empire has been using them to dump garbage (and the odd individual who has outlived his usefulness). This is a fine place to dispose of any bodies, and the heroes will become aware of the <strong>Drains</strong> as a possible exit from <strong>Prak City</strong>. This particular tube delivers any bodies (or heroes who chance it) to <strong>Location 1</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.</p>\n<p>If the heroes deliver <strong>Seejo</strong> from the fate he feared, he invites them to his sad excuse for a dwelling. As <strong>Seejo</strong> explains, the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to <strong>Prakith’s</strong> second moon infested with <strong>mynocks</strong>, resulting in his firing and the loss of his ship. His former employers sent him on the next shuttle to <strong>Prakith,</strong> but that was no favor. The Duros explains that the Empire has made it impossible for him to make a living, and now he’s at his wit’s end. If he can’t find employment quickly, he’ll be at the mercy of the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> thugs anywhere he goes on <strong>Prak City</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo</strong> asks about the condition of the heroes’ ship. He begs for the tedious assignment of inspecting their vessel in port over the next <strong>few days</strong>. “<em><strong>Trust me! I’ll have a tool kit this time! I’ll deliver your ship to you, wherever you are!</strong></em>” <strong>Seejo</strong> seems trustworthy enough, and the heroes know that the security system on their ship is such that he wouldn’t be able to activate the hyperdrive. If the players still turn him down, he mention that he know all the Empire's tricks and can make sure they dont plant any bugs, bombs or any other surprises on the player's ship.</p>\n<p>If hired, <strong>Seejo</strong> grows chipper again and gives the heroes his <strong>comlink ID number</strong> before darting off toward the <strong>spaceport.</strong> (The Duros thus provides a possible means of escape later for heroes in the <strong>Citadel</strong>, but if the heroes refuse his help now, they will have other options.)</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Shadowy Figure</h2>\n<p>As another day begins and ends on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the heroes find their continued presence in <strong>Prak City</strong> is meeting with diminishing returns. The military areas are unwelcoming, with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> here and there keeping a watch on this important Imperial asset. Only the miners seem to have any regular access to the area between <strong>Prak City</strong> and the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> There are meager opportunities to defy the Empire in the <strong>Work Zone;</strong> the heroes might succeed at a sabotage attempt on a construction site once, but the area will be saturated with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> thereafter. And reports among the workers say that as more and more of <strong>Prak City</strong> is up and running, <strong>Inquisitor</strong> sweeps of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> are on the increase.</p>\n<p>The heroes always have the feeling that they’re being followed, which is confirmed one night in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> after a successful<strong> DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A shadowy figure darts from cover to cover in the alleys of the <strong>Work Zone,</strong> keeping an eye on the party. But the instant the heroes spot their follower, they realize it’s not an <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> but something else.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Spotted, a tall shadow falls back toward a construction area, diving for a crawlspace underneath a parked crane.

His <strong>Basic</strong> vocabulary is very limited; there’s no telling where he picked it up, but Stereb are great mimics. He’s been lost in <strong>Prak City</strong> for <strong>several days</strong>, and he seems to have come from below. Imperial drilling on the plateau attracted his attention, as a few inquiries reveal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where did you come from?</strong> “<em>From Prakith. From inside, where the vital air and fluids nourish the Worldflesh.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you get stuck here?</strong> “<em>I saw the holes where the parasites were fouling our caverns with their filth. I followed the hidden waters’ flow upward and found a passage to this place. But Prakith was weak, and the footing crumbled.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How long have you been up here in Prak City?</strong> “<em>Since I arrived.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why do you trust us?</strong> “<em>I saw you help the green man against the people who chased me. You are not of them. Perhaps you are of the stone.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there another way to your home? </strong>“<em>The pits they have drilled reach there. But I know what awaits below now. I fear to go alone. But with you, perhaps . . .</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why are you hiding here?</strong> “<em>I want to go home, to return before it is too late. You cannot leave them untended. You will help me reach what I hear them call the Drains.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If asked what cannot be left untended or what waits for him below, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> will mention a single word: <strong>greethka.</strong> But he cannot translate it into any word the heroes understand.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Down the Drains</h2>\n<p>Before the heroes’ conversation can continue, a spotlight shines into the construction site from a ship hovering above. “<em><strong>Halt!</strong></em>” comes the call. “<strong><em>You there! Halt on command of the Inquisitorius!</em>”</strong> The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are on a routine sweep of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> for anything out of the ordinary—just to terrorize the locals and remind them the Empire is in charge—and they’ve also been hearing reports of a strange alien lurking around. For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[r65rhUzYEtxeQFzb]{9-03 Curious Inquisitor}</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> they find a code cylinder on him that assists in the entry to <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius.</strong> Dispatching <strong>Jorad,</strong> his team, or the shuttle brings a response in the form of another “<strong>@JournalEntry[8VNmuO9I48ODoIh0]{9-02 Prak City Security Force}</strong>” encounter, so heroes should quickly move to escape the area. <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> running to the south at the opening of this encounter, encourages the heroes to enter the <strong>Drains</strong> with him before seemingly disappearing. The shuttle can be commandeered, although since it has a tracking device onboard, it will not get far before <strong>TIE fighters</strong> arrive to ground it.</p>\n<p>On closer inspection, the heroes see that this is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> bore-holes drilled at a sharp (<strong>80-degree</strong>) angle far down through the rock. <strong>Herdr’tui’s</strong> distant holler emanates from far below, indicating that he’s slid down quickly and seemingly safely.

These <strong>thugs</strong> are in the employ of the <strong>Darga the</strong> <strong>Hutt </strong>and feel no real loyalty to <strong>Raden </strong>other than the fact that <strong>Darga </strong>ordered them to accompany the Devaronian.

Left for dead and stranded on <strong>Parein II’s fourth moon</strong>, a weakened <strong>Draco</strong> was stalked by a <strong>nighthunter.</strong> Ultimately, <strong>Draco</strong> subdued the beast in a vicious confrontation, but not before the creature bit off his left thumb and clamped its massive fangs down around his throat. <strong>Draco</strong> has since replaced the missing thumb with a cybernetic substitute, while masking the glaring scars around his neck with the high collar of his Inquisitor’s tunic.</p>\n<p><strong>Draco</strong> arrived in the <strong>Cularin</strong> system in the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer <em><strong>Assiduous,</strong></em> accompanied by a Lictor-class Imperial dungeon ship, <em><strong>Revelator.</strong></em> However, unable to traverse the comet field in the vessel, <strong>Draco</strong> and his entourage made the journey to <strong>Almas</strong> in a Theta class shuttle, tucked safely away at what’s left of the <strong>Forard</strong> spaceport.</p>\n<h4>Inquisitor Valin Draco Tactics</h4>\n<p><strong>Valin Draco</strong> activates his <strong>Rage power </strong>and engages the players in melee combat, using <strong>Saber Reflect </strong>or <strong>Parry</strong> when appropriate.

A Zelosian, he defied nearly every stereotype of his gregarious people except for his knowledge of plant biology, and his Sith moniker is believed to have been culled from a corrupted Sith text, possibly written by <strong>Darth Revan.</strong> As the reigning Dark Lord of the Sith sometime between <strong>1,150</strong> and <strong>1,400 years ago,</strong> <strong>Rivan’s</strong> story is intimately tied to an object he called the <strong>Darkstaff.</strong> Drawn to this dark side artifact, <strong>Rivan</strong> erected a stronghold on the poisonous planet <strong>Almas,</strong> using the <strong>Force</strong> and his biological knowledge to terraform the world into a paradise. At first, <strong>Rivan</strong> desired to possess the <strong>Darkstaff,</strong> but when he learned that it was a malevolent vacuum of power, he became bent on destroying it.</p>\n<p>During the New Sith Wars, <strong>Darth Rivan</strong> consolidated many dark siders into an army. To circumvent the betrayals common among Sith, he pioneered the creation of Battlelords. This radical process bonded one of <strong>Rivan’s</strong> Sith commanders—the <strong>Battlelord</strong>—through the <strong>Force</strong> to his or her troops, such that if subordinates tried to injure or kill their superior, the alchemical bond insured that the traitors would instead be the recipients of the <strong>damage</strong> they intended to inflict.</p>\n<p>During a pivotal battle, <strong>Rivan</strong> simply vanished from the combat zone in a catastrophic and violent way. Legend relates that <strong>Rivan</strong> at last obtained possession of the <strong>Darkstaff</strong> that he both craved and feared, and that it created a hyperspace wormhole, known as a <strong>Force Storm,</strong> that annihilated <strong>Rivan’s Battlelord</strong> army. Caught in the eye of this unnatural tempest, <strong>Rivan</strong> was flung to a time and place far removed from <strong>Almas.</strong> He found himself on the planet <strong>Ruusan,</strong> caught in the War of Light and Dark between Lord Hoth’s Army of Light and Lord Kaan’s Brotherhood of Darkness. The <strong>Darkstaff</strong> left <strong>Rivan</strong> bereft of the <strong>Force,</strong> and when he encountered a <strong>Force-user</strong> of inconsequential power, the <strong>Dark Lord</strong> was easily dispatched.</p>\n<p>Under the influence of <strong>dark</strong> <strong>Force</strong> energies on <strong>Almas,</strong> the gatekeeper of <strong>Darth Rivan’s holocron</strong> has been given the ability to function independently and of its own free will, acting as the real Rivan would.</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[QmrCwsoYHc8gXJeB]{Darth Rivan's Holocron Gatekeeper}</strong></p>\n<h4>Darth Rivan's Holocron Gatekeeper Tactics</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> will attempt to avoid placing the friendly Imperial troops within its aura but if it thinks that it can harm the players it will do so despite the risk to its allies.

Imperial <strong>shadow troopers</strong> might be mistaken for regular <strong>clone troopers,</strong> except that their stealth armor and red visors give them the appearance of demonic silhouettes. They are trained for reconnaissance and occasionally serve as guardians to vital facilities and personnel. <strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> reasons that if they’re good enough for the Emperor’s secret <strong>Utapau</strong> storehouse, they’re good enough for him.</p>\n<p>Unlike that of other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow trooper</strong> armor retains its distinctive pre-Imperial appearance. There is talk of eventually streamlining <strong>shadow trooper</strong> armor, but for now, their scarlet T-visors remain a haunting reminder of Palpatine’s bloody ascension to the rank of Emperor. Like all other <strong>stormtroopers, shadow troopers</strong> cannot be bribed, blackmailed, or seduced.

She attempted to undermine the <strong>Jedi</strong> by impersonating members of the <strong>Jedi Order</strong> while publicly performing acts of sabotage and chaos. <strong>Muun</strong> also learned of the existence of an evil creature called a <strong>t'salak,</strong> and by kidnapping and impersonating a <strong>Jedi,</strong> she gained possession of the beast. Successfully fissioning the creature into multiple entities, she attempted to use two <strong>t'salaks</strong> to turn some <strong>Jedi</strong> into crazed killers during a peace conference. Her plan failed, but <strong>Master Kirlocca</strong> lost his life defeating the <strong>t'salaks,</strong> and <strong>Raik</strong> escaped.</p>\n<p>When <strong>Raik</strong> returned to her base on the planet <strong>Tilnes,</strong> she learned about the decimation of <strong>Jedi</strong> throughout the galaxy as a result of <strong>Order 66.</strong> Her revenge was now denied, but she could still fuel the rumors of the <strong>“Jedi Rebellion.” Raik</strong> went to <strong>Coruscant</strong> to confront those responsible for the destruction of the self-righteous <strong>Force-users,</strong> not sure if she should thank them or kill them. That’s when she met <strong>Valin Draco.</strong> The <strong>Inquisitor</strong> saw enormous potential in the wild-eyed <strong>Dark</strong> <strong>Jedi </strong>and asked her to join him. <strong>Raik</strong> felt that she had finally found someone who would love her back.</p>\n<p><strong>Raik</strong> has accompanied <strong>Draco</strong> on various assignments, indulging in the opportunity to hunt <strong>Jedi.</strong> When <strong>Draco</strong> travels to <strong>Almas, Raik's</strong> familiarity with the academy proves essential, as does the <strong>t’salak</strong> she brought along.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The fire-haired woman stalks toward you, clad in a dark version of the Inquisitor’s attire.

Most <strong>Ugnaught riggers</strong> are tough customers for beings of such small stature, and they are accustomed to working under extreme conditions. These particular <strong>riggers</strong> have become weary of their menial lives and see the chance to work for <strong>Darga </strong>as a way to get away from <strong>Cloud City</strong> for good.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\"><em>This small porcine being grunts as he shuffles around the refinery floor.

They prefer to take shots at the players while still moving to take <strong>cover</strong> from distant opponents.</p>\n<h4>Ugnaught Boss</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Ugnaught boss</strong> is an experienced leader among the <strong>riggers</strong> and has proven to be a devious and capable agent for <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. The <strong>boss</strong> is the mastermind behind the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> siphoning process and can motivate his fellow <strong>riggers</strong> even though the threat of being caught looms over them.

This first adventure will get the heroes together and launch them down a path to making a big difference in the galaxy, and the heroes should advance to <strong>3rd level</strong> by the conclusion of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this adventure, the heroes should become acquainted with one another, meet up with famous <strong>Senator Bail Organa</strong>, and travel to the remote planet of <strong>Felucia </strong>to recover a former Imperial Admiral who has information about a secret project that the Empire has hatched in the months since its rise.</p>\n<h2>Starting the Campaign</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign opens some months after the rise of the Empire, with the <strong>Clone Wars</strong> a very recent and vivid memory for most beings in the galaxy. The Empire has begun tightening its grip on star systems throughout the galaxy, and <strong>Darth Vader</strong> stands at the newly declared Emperor’s right hand, crushing any opposition and hunting down the last remnants of the <strong>Jedi Order</strong>. In these short months since the fall of the Republic, many have joined the Empire willingly, including the <strong>Core Worlds</strong> whose Human nobles stand to benefit a great deal from its tyranny. Similarly, many others have begun rebelling against Imperial oppression, finding themselves driven out of their homes (or worse) and forced to live in a galaxy that tolerates no opposition to the Empire. Throughout the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, the heroes must deal with the reality that the Empire is a monolithic threat without any kind of organized opposition, and dealing with agents of the Empire can be dangerous.</p>\n<p>Despite the difficulties the heroes face in terms of Imperial dominance, they are in a unique position to deal the first significant blow against the Empire. In the first adventure, the heroes will come face to face with the man who will become their clandestine benefactor,<strong> @Actor[AW42z0dZy9xfg1gJ]{Senator Bail Organa}</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">. In the new Empire, seditious acts are punished harshly, and as such the heroes will find that they must be extremely cautious in their actions. With nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, the heroes of the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Dawn of Defiance</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> campaign may find that a one-way trip to </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Kessel</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> is the best they can hope for if they fall into the hands of the Empire.</span></p>\n<p>The first act of the campaign (comprised of the first three adventures—<em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, and <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>) introduces the heroes to one another and to some of the key figures in the campaign. Over the course of the first arc, the heroes discover that the Empire has a secret project in the works that could have dire consequences for the galaxy if it comes to fruition. Thanks to the help of former Imperial <strong>@Actor[JJXelfwaesLxl5DV]{Admiral Gilder Varth}</strong>, whom the heroes should rescue at the conclusion to the first adventure, the heroes learn that the Empire’s secret project has left a trail of money and slaves that they can follow to find the truth. During the first three adventures, the heroes travel to famous planets such as <strong>Alderaan</strong>, <strong>Bespin</strong>, <strong>Cato </strong><strong>Neimoidia</strong>, and <strong>Felucia</strong>, fighting Imperial stormtroopers, destroying secret labs and prisons, encountering vile Hutt gangsters, and participating in a dangerous <strong>sabacc </strong>tournament where the buy-in might be more than they can afford. The first adventure, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, is relatively straightforward, allowing the heroes to become accustomed to one another and the rules. Each subsequent adventure leads the heroes down new paths and introduces different styles of play.</p>\n<p>Certain kinds of heroes will find it easier than others to flourish in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. First and foremost, the heroes should view the Empire as both a threat and an enemy. As the major villainous entity of the campaign, the Empire represents something that is to be feared and loathed, and characters with Imperial sympathies will likely fisnd themselves in conflict with the overarching plot. Otherwise, the heroes can come from almost any background and profession. As long as they are willing to fight against the Empire (both covertly and openly), they should find the campaign engaging and exciting. Not every hero needs to be an idealistic freedom fighter; smugglers, bounty hunters, and free traders have just as much to gain from weakening the Empire as rebellious troops do. If the heroes’ motivation is personal profit or increasing their own power, they could do worse than to work for<strong> Bail Organa</strong>. Not only is he rich, but he is also powerful and influential, and his influence could very easily be transferred to any heroes that get on his good side.</p>\n<h3><strong>Adventure Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>After a chance encounter on a space station with a desperate agent of <strong>Senator Bail Organa </strong>of <strong>Alderaan</strong>, the heroes negotiate with a local crime lord and obtain valuable cargo intended for the Senator. Once they deliver the cargo, the heroes learn that it is actually a <strong>man frozen in carbonite</strong> who carries secret information for the Senator. Based on this information, the heroes are hired (as friends of<strong> Bail Organa</strong>, enemies of the Empire, or freelance entrepreneurs) to fly to the planet <strong>Felucia </strong>and discover the fate of a turncoat <strong>Imperial Admiral</strong>. If the Admiral still lives, they are to bring him back to <strong>Alderaan</strong>.</p>\n<p>The heroes arrive to find <strong>Felucia </strong>under tight Imperial control. After a brief skirmish with some Imperial starships in orbit, their ship makes a hard landing on <strong>Felucia</strong> to avoid detection. The ship is damaged, though <strong>@Actor[TgAWl2DRpBm2ZdsF]{Captain Okeefe}</strong> believes it can be repaired. Once they are prepared, the heroes venture out into <strong>Felucia’s</strong> jungles in search of signs of civilization. After fighting their way through the local flora and fauna, they discover a hidden village of <strong>Felucians </strong>that have fled deep into the jungles to escape Imperial oppression.</p>\n<p>The heroes negotiate for a guide to take them to a nearby Imperial facility known to the locals as the “Vanishing Place.” In truth, this is a prison for Imperial dissidents and traitors where <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>is being held. The heroes prepare to set off for the prison when a cry goes up in the village—a scout trooper has just spotted the village and is headed back to alert the Empire! This leads into a chase scene in which the heroes ride <strong>kybucks</strong> in pursuit of the scout trooper. Once the trooper has been stopped, the heroes convince the <strong>Felucians</strong> to lead them to the Imperial base immediately so that they can rescue the Admiral and stop bringing danger to the hidden village.</p>\n<p>The heroes and their guide set off for the Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong>. It is heavily guarded from the outside, but the <strong>Felucian</strong> guide knows a secret way in. Once inside the base, the heroes find it more lightly guarded (and more along the lines of what they can handle). During the search for <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, the heroes come across a communication from Imperial <strong>Naval Command </strong>indicating that <strong>@Actor[5tYqNdhpDw7L64vf]{Inquisitor Valin Draco}</strong> is en route to <strong>Felucia</strong> to take custody of the Admiral. The heroes fight their way through the facility and eventually find <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> in the detention block. They free him and head back to the secret entrance where their <strong>Felucian</strong> guide supposedly awaits their return.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the heroes find trouble instead. Their guide lies dead, and Imperials are gathering outside the facility. About this time, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> sends the heroes a message: She has completed repairs to her ship and can pick them up when they are ready. On their way to the roof, the heroes must deal with the cruel <strong>&lt;&lt;Captain Vischera&gt;&gt;</strong> and his genetically modified bodyguards. Once they reach the roof, they board <strong>Okeefe’s</strong> ship and blast off from <strong>Felucia</strong>.</p>\n<p>The adventure concludes as the heroes bring <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> to the rendezvous point designated by <strong>Senator Organa</strong>. There, the heroes are introduced to the Nebulon-B frigate <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, which has been commissioned by <strong>Organa</strong> to serve as a mobile hiding place for the Admiral. Aboard the Resurgence, <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>is debriefed and provides the heroes and <strong>Senator Organa</strong> with information related to a top-secret Imperial project.</p>\n<h3>Opening Crawl</h3>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before their first adventure, consider using the boxed text below to introduce the Dawn of Defiance campaign:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[eDWVCu54lvTtXZzZ]{Opening Crawl}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>","folder":"ltQz712CRglJoUNT","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

These <strong>clone troopers</strong> have abandoned their usual white armor and instead have been garbed as escorts of Imperial nobility.

{"_id":"s6AtjC2B6ljwyj2m","name":"Part 3: Skirmish Over Bespin","content":"<h1>Part 3: Skirmish Over Bespin</h1>\n<p>With the tournament over, the <strong>credits</strong> safe, and <strong>Silas Draver</strong> dealt with, the players have a chance to catch up to<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>. Having witnessed the transaction between the <strong>Imperial officer</strong> and <strong>Darga’s Hapan proxy</strong>, the players know that <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> has the information they need to find their quarry, and that she can likely reveal the full depth of <strong>Darga’s </strong>involvement in the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> was gravely wounded in the firefight with <strong>Silas Draver</strong> and his goons. With <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> dead and <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> on the edge of death, the players should waste no time in talking to her. She might be their last chance to learn <strong>Darga’s</strong> whereabouts.</p>\n<h2>Questioning Lady Fioro</h2>\n<p>Errant blaster bolts from <strong>Silas Draver’s</strong> attempted robbery caught <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> off guard, injuring her seriously. However, she is still conscious and able to answer questions. While <strong>Jacc Mandelbrot’s</strong> security team tries to clean up the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> the players have a few moments to interrogate <strong>Lady Fioro</strong> before the authorities arrive. She is weak and fading from consciousness, but all the fight has gone out of her. She doesn’t bother to deceive the players because she believes (perhaps rightly so) that she is only moments from death.</p>\n<p>Below are the answers to some questions that the players probably have for <strong>Lady Fioro:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Who are you really?</strong> “<em>Mirana Fioro. I’m from Hapes, but I’m no noble. My father was a pirate, and he raised me aboard his ship. I’ve been pretending to be a noblewoman for years.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are you working for Darga the Hutt? </strong>“<em>Yes. I’ve been Darga’s agent for three years now. He instructed me to enter the tournament and take payment from the Imperial officer.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Where is Darga? </strong>“<em>In one of the lower docking bays on the underside of the city. Docking bay 4414. He’s been living on his luxury yacht, though now that he has the codes, I doubt he’ll be around for long. If he’s still in Cloud City within the hour, I’ll be surprised.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What was the code that Lt. Arandis transferred to you? </strong>“<em>It was the command codes for the slave circuit for a ship in orbit. A Gallofree Medium Transport. I sent the code to Darga just before the fight broke out. You’ve got to have a special computer to control it, but there’s one on board Darga’s yacht.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What is on that Medium Transport? </strong>“<em>Slaves, used in some secret Imperial project. Darga has been taking them as a partial payment from the Empire. They’re mostly decrepit and used up, but he resells them to other slavers from his palace on Cato Neimoidia.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What does Darga have to do with the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>I don’t know. I’ve only heard it mentioned. But for months now, he’s been trading huge amounts of Tibanna gas to the Empire in exchange for slaves and credits. The Empire always seems to want more.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uncovering the Worm</h2>\n<p>With information in hand about finding <strong>Darga</strong>, the players will likely set off to find the <strong>Hutt</strong> at last. Additionally, thanks to the information given to them by <strong>Mirana Fioro,</strong> the players also know the extent of <strong>Darga’s </strong>involvement with the Empire, and particularly altruistic players probably jump at the chance to free slaves of the Empire. However, <strong>Darga </strong>has also received word of the events that took place in the <strong>Royal Casino,</strong> and he is taking no chances. The <strong>Hutt</strong> has ordered his belongings packed onto his yacht and is planning on taking off as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the players have survived and are likely coming for him, <strong>Darga </strong>pulls every string he has with the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> and instructs security personnel in his employ to keep the players from getting to his shuttle at all costs. As the players travel through the city trying to reach <strong>docking bay 4414,</strong> they are ambushed by <strong>Bespin security guards</strong> with Imperial loyalties. With the death of <strong>Lt. Arandis,</strong> a small contingent of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> and an <strong>Imperial officer</strong> remain in the city. <strong>Darga </strong>saw to it that they were informed of the players’ role in the <strong>Lieutenant’s</strong> death, and he has painted them as the villains behind the scheme.</p>\n<h2>Streets of Cloud City</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[TPeBw5GCgx7wNyge]{3-05 Streets of Cloud City}</strong></p>\n<p>When the players escape the ambush, they have very little time to reach <strong>docking bay 4414.</strong> They travel deeper into the city, and at their footsteps they often hear the sounds of pursuit. Occasionally, they hear shouts of “<em><strong>This way!</strong></em>” and “<em><strong>I think they’re heading down to a lower level!</strong></em>” echoing through the halls behind them. The muffled, electronic sound of the voices should indicate that a <strong>squad of stormtroopers</strong> remains in pursuit, dedicated to stopping the players from leaving <strong>Bespin</strong> alive.</p>\n<p>When they finally reach the docking bay they seek, they should realize that they are just in time. The <strong>Hutt</strong> and his minions are still outside of the ship, which looms large in the <strong>docking bay,</strong> and it looks as though they have been loading huge crates (filled with contraband that <strong>Darga</strong> picked up during his stay in <strong>Cloud City)</strong> onto the <strong>yacht.</strong> There is no time to talk. The Empire is at the players’ heels, and <strong>Darga’s goons</strong> know better than to wait for their boss to give the order to attack. With the <strong>Hutt</strong> shouting encouragement, Darga’s cronies and the <strong>stormtroopers</strong> try to put an end to the players’ meddling.</p>\n<h2>Hutt's Hanger</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[fKxFdraV4kLb55oT]{3-06 Hutt's Hanger}</strong></p>\n<h2>Covering the Empire's Track</h2>\n<p>Though his thugs have been defeated and the Empire is too far away to help, the Hutt <strong>crime lord</strong> is nonetheless defiant as he faces the players. Whether he is a prisoner or merely dying of his wounds, <strong>Darga </strong>cannot resist taunting the players one last time. Before he dies (or is otherwise subdued), <strong>Darga </strong>has a few choice words. Read the following text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Darga gives a low groan and rolls his eyes before letting out a wheezing laugh. His words are almost dragged out of him, but despite this, he seems to be smiling that sickly Hutt smile that often graces his enormous face.</em></p>\n<p><em>“I should have killed you the first time you walked into my palace. You think you’ve done something right, but you’re gravely mistaken. At least those slaves would have lived if I’d sold them, but you’ve condemned them to die. The Empire won’t let them live on the chance that they might reveal the truth. The deaths of thousands will be on your hands!”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>The Arrival of the Assiduous</h2>\n<p>If the players used lethal force with <strong>Darga</strong>, he expires after delivering that coda. Otherwise, he simply refuses to speak further. Just moments after they finish with <strong>the Hutt</strong>, however, the players receive a call from <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> on the <em><strong>Banshee.</strong></em> According to her sensors, the Imperial I class Star Destroyer<strong> <em>Assiduous</em></strong> just emerged from hyperspace at the edge of the system and began transmitting extensive messages on the slave circuit to the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon.</em></strong> It beamed similar messages to a <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> that had been sitting inert in the space above <strong>Bespin</strong> until now. As the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> launched a number of <strong>TIE fighters,</strong> all of which are screaming toward <strong>Bespin,</strong> the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> fired its engines and set in a new course—a course leading it directly at the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon.</strong></em> <strong>Crash</strong> has made the calculations, and the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> will collide with the <strong>Medium Transport</strong> in a <strong>matter of minutes</strong>, destroying both ships completely—and killing all the <strong>slaves</strong> on the <strong>Medium Transport.</strong></p>\n<h2>Stopping the Tibanna Gas Hauler</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> hauler is careening through space toward the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon,</em></strong> a <strong>Medium Transport</strong> with thousands of <strong>slaves</strong> onboard. A group of <strong>TIE fighters</strong> is on its way toward <strong>Bespin,</strong> likely to finish the job in case the <strong>hauler</strong> doesn’t completely destroy the <strong>slave ship.</strong> The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is only <strong>minutes away</strong> from being in range of the planet, and the Empire knows the players are in <strong>Cloud City</strong> and were involved in the death of <strong>Lt. Arandis</strong> (even if they weren’t directly responsible).</p>\n<p>Things look pretty dire for the players, and they may be tempted to cut their losses and make a break for it. However, <strong>thousands of slaves</strong> will die if they do. Moreover, those <strong>slaves</strong> are clearly involved in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> and stopping the <strong><em>Shackles of Nizon</em></strong> from being destroyed could give them another lead.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>hangar</strong> are <strong>six</strong> <strong>Z-95 headhunter starfighters </strong>that belonged to <strong>Darga the Hutt’s</strong> escorts. These ships, while not in pristine condition, are well maintained, powered up, and ready to fly. It actually takes very little skill to fly the ships (even an untrained pilot could maneuver them well enough), and<strong> high Intelligence</strong> characters are exceptionally good candidates to pilot the starfighters. Don’t be afraid to encourage the players to hop in the <strong>Headhunters;</strong> it will give individual players more to do during the <strong>final two encounters</strong> of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Another option for some of the players is to take command of <strong>Darga’s luxury yacht</strong>, the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em>. This is a great chance for the players to get a ship of their own that they can use for the rest of the campaign, and could provide characters who aren’t great pilots with a chance to participate in the battle as gunners. Likewise, a few players could man the laser cannons aboard the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> while <strong>Okeefe</strong> and <strong>Crash</strong> pilot the transport. If some players want to take starfighters, a few want to steal the <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em>, and a few more want to act as gunners on the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> that’s OK. It adds a bit of diversity to the last two encounters in the adventure, and it helps ensure that no characters are just “<strong>sitting in the ship</strong>” at the end. It takes <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> a few seconds to bring the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> around to pick the players up, and after that, they can blast off into the skies of <strong>Bespin</strong> together. The <em><strong>Glorious Chariot</strong></em> and <strong>Z-95 Headhunter</strong> stat's are below and use the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> stats from <strong>Dawn of Defiance Episode 1</strong>.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/vehicles_and_starships/sorosuub_3000_luxury_yacht_art.webp\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">@JournalEntry[2yTgjMBX5qqaBHxD]{05 - Handout 5 - \"Glorious Chariot\"}</p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[9GHE6q0UwN12ntbS]{Z-95 Headhunter}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[goyd0zM01f3s0bOl]{\"Glorious Chariot\"}</strong></p>\n<p>As the players scream over <strong>Cloud City</strong> in their ships, members of the <strong>Wing Guard</strong> begin pursuit. Some have been ordered by the Empire to shoot down any ships attempting to leave <strong>Cloud City,</strong> and they pursue the players’ ships with lethal intent.</p>\n<h2>Flight from Cloud City</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[peXsoGI6k3mmof70]{3-07 Flight from Cloud City}</strong></p>\n<p>Once the players get out of the atmosphere, they must contend with the forces of the Empire. Though the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is too far away to reach the Tibanna gas hauler, it has sent TIE fighters to make sure that the Shackles of Nizon is destroyed one way or another. When the players leave the atmosphere, they have only a limited amount of time to destroy the Tibanna gas hauler before it collides with the Shackles of Nizon.</p>\n<h2>Skirmish Over Bespin</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[XMDxAd30slZJU3UP]{3-08 Skirmish Over Bespin}</strong></p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>At the end of the adventure, assuming the players succeeded, the <strong>Tibanna gas hauler</strong> does not destroy the <em><strong>Shackles of Nizon</strong></em>. A few short moments after the ship’s safety is assured, the players receive a simple text message from the <strong>Medium Transport:</strong> “<strong><em>We have gained control. Thank you.</em></strong>” The engines of the ship flare, and <strong>seconds later,</strong> it makes a jump to <strong>hyperspace,</strong> with no other fanfare.</p>\n<p>However, all is not safe in the <strong>Bespin</strong> system. The <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> is fast approaching, and the players definitely don’t want to stick around to answer a lot of questions from the Empire. While the navcomputers aboard the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em> plot their course, the players can see the distant dagger shape of the Star Destroyer rapidly approaching their position. It becomes clear that the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> won’t be in range until well after the players have jumped to <strong>hyperspace,</strong> but the ship comes on nonetheless. Just before the players jump, they receive a visual communication from the <em><strong>Assiduous</strong></em> (if they refuse to open a communications channel, the message can be sent as a recording to the <em><strong>Banshee,</strong></em> and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> can play it for them). Read the following text aloud when the players view the message:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>The image on the screen resolves to show the bridge of the Star Destroyer <strong>Assiduous.</strong> Standing before the viewscreen is a darkly handsome man wearing long, flowing robes. The hilt of a lightsaber hangs from his belt.</em></p>\n<p><em>“My sensor operators tell me that your ship will be far enough from Bespin to jump to hyperspace before I can reach you. I congratulate you on your victory here, but know this: the Inquisitorius never rests. My name is Valin Draco, and I will find you and make you pay for meddling here. You may have bested that slimy Hutt, but I can assure you that the affections of an Inquisitor are not so gentle.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>End of the First Story Arc</h2>\n<p>The end of <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness </strong></em>concludes the first story arc in the <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign. By the end of this adventure, the players have learned that the Empire has been using slaves in the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> and that they are in great need of large quantities of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> as well. They have seen <strong>Valin Draco,</strong> if at a distance, and now find themselves known to the Empire. When the players return to the Nebulon-B cruiser <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, they are welcomed by <strong>Captain Verana,</strong> who debriefs the players and seems amazed at all they were able to accomplish. He and his crew begin to analyze the data in the <em><strong>Banshee’s</strong></em> sensor systems that was brought back from <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> and <strong>Bespin,</strong> and they continue the search for the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> there.</p>\n<p>Similar to the gaps between the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> films, the end of this adventure provides a perfect time for you to take care of any lingering issues from the first third of the campaign. The players should be <strong>7th level</strong> by the time the adventure ends. If any of them are behind the curve, you can insert some small adventures of your own to help get them a little closer to the appropriate level.</p>\n<p>If any player characters died during<em><strong> The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em>, the gap between adventures serves as a good place to introduce new characters. Additionally, if any of the players have goals to be taken care of during downtime—such as refurbishing the interior of the <strong><em>Glorious Chariot,</em></strong> installing special modifications to their ships, or constructing their own lightsabers—now is a good time to let those things happen. With the extremely fast pace of <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> adventures, it may be difficult to find time for more mundane activities during upcoming adventures.</p>\n<h2>Advancing the Campaign Timeline</h2>\n<p>One option you should consider is a large advancement in the campaign’s timeline. The gaps between many of the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> films leave months and even years unexplained, and doing the same for the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign could help not only make it feel more like the <em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em> movies but also provide interesting options for character development. You can choose how far ahead to jump, though jumping forward more than <strong>two</strong> or <strong>three years</strong> can be troublesome. During that time period, the players continue to work for the <strong>Alderaanian Resistance,</strong> operating out of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, but getting no closer to the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> They have few major adventures, and characters might change significantly between <em><strong>The Queen of Air and Darkness</strong></em> and the fourth adventure in the campaign,<em><strong> Echoes of the Jedi</strong></em>. Just as Luke goes from being a Rebel pilot to a full-blown Jedi between <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em> and <em><strong>Return of the Jedi</strong></em>, a player might receive a major overhaul to help him or her fit in better with the rest of the group.</p>\n<p>A large time jump also gives you the opportunity to allow a player to rebuild his or her character. Since the campaign began, the player might have found new options to try or might have learned that certain talents or feats weren’t used much. If you choose to let the player rebuild his character, he should keep the ability scores the same but otherwise can rebuild the character from the ground up, choosing new classes, talents, and feats. The player shouldn’t change too drastically and must remain recognizable, and the new statistics for the character should reflect a logical evolution. For example, rebuilding a Jedi as a scoundrel and not taking the <strong>Force Sensitivity feat</strong> is probably too big of a leap, but a scholar being rebuilt with fighter levels could reflect the player taking a larger role in the <strong>Alderaanian Resistance.</strong> You should work with your players to ensure that such changes make sense for the characters and provide new depth and story options for the players.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\">Note:</strong><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> finishing the adventure</span><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"> should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"s8n15L6XKq1X7hLG","name":"Part 2: In the Heart of the Empire","content":"<h1>Part 2: In the Heart of the Empire</h1>\n<p>Having taken care of their bureaucratic obligations, the heroes are free to explore the city. This section of the adventure is nonlinear, allowing the heroes to follow leads using their best skills and ideas. They likely will attempt several methods at once, with different characters gravitating to their strengths. If possible, you should encourage them to focus on one lead at a time for simplicity, rather than letting them split up the party. All characters should contribute to the investigation somehow, perhaps by using a skill, meeting with a contact that nobody else has access to, or simply providing muscle when investigating the less savory levels of <strong>Coruscant.</strong></p>\n<p>The heroes must learn the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new tower called the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> houses the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> (learned from <strong>Resh,</strong> from <strong>CZ-3T6,</strong> or by detecting <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> transmissions from the tower)</li>\n<li>An <strong>ISB code cylinder</strong> is required to access the tower (learned from <strong>Resh)</strong></li>\n<li>How to enter the tower and acquire the equipment needed to do so (learned from <strong>Resh</strong> and investigating the building itself)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the heroes must obtain the <strong>code cylinder</strong> from <strong>Agent Dos.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[9Ajz6TuMBgSluiJB]{01 - Handout 1 - Part 2 Checklist}</strong></p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>The heroes must first see to their ship. A <strong>Cloudscape administrator</strong> meets them immediately after the <strong>customs inspector</strong> is done. Docking fees are <strong>1,000 credits per day</strong> plus any additional services they desire, such as refueling. The ship remains on the platform unless the heroes wish to upgrade to an <strong>internal hangar</strong> for <strong>quadruple</strong> the cost. Security is quite good, especially with <strong>stormtroopers</strong> on the premises. The heroes may stay aboard their ship, but they should find that a hotel closer to transportation hubs is more convenient and less public. If needed, they can locate a ship’s parking platform in the mid-levels at <strong>half the cost</strong> by making a<strong> DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Accommodations</h3>\n<p>There are essentially three levels of <strong>accommodation</strong> available, with quality equating to their level on <strong>Coruscant.</strong> <strong>Luxury hotels</strong> are on the <strong>upper levels</strong>, start at <strong>500 credits per day</strong> for a basic room, and quickly increase in price. Hotels with names such as <strong>The Imperial</strong> provide almost any service to the wealthier beings of the galaxy. Aliens are unwelcome here, and privacy is obtained only through bribery. In the <strong>mid-levels,</strong> chain establishments such as <strong>Sleep Center</strong> are tolerant of alien guests, and their upscale rooms start at <strong>200 credits per day</strong>. Finally, in the <strong>lowest levels</strong> of <strong>Coruscant,</strong> rooms generally start at <strong>100 credits per day</strong>, though meager accommodations may be found for <strong>50 credits per day</strong>. In either case, security is poor, aliens are common, and establishments such as <strong>Gert’s Low Street Hostel</strong> take little interest in its guests.</p>\n<h3>Transportation</h3>\n<p>The heroes likely will want to use their own airspeeder. If they didn’t bring one along, they may rent one for <strong>300 credits per day </strong>or buy one for <strong>10,000 credits.</strong> When flying through <strong>Coruscant,</strong> they must stick to established traffic lanes or draw the attention of the traffic patrol.</p>\n<p>Through the course of their investigation, they should discover that obtaining a “<strong>Class III Restricted</strong>” transponder would allow them to legally roam free of the skylanes in all but the military and most restricted areas of the planet. Of course, it is difficult to acquire such a <strong>transponder.</strong> Their best bet is to try to find one in the lower levels from <strong>Eetoa Ro</strong> or another shady agent (<strong>DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>, the <strong>DC</strong> for characters who have contacts on <strong>Coruscant</strong> is reduced by <strong>10).</strong> The starting bid for the device is <strong>30,000 credits.</strong></p>\n<p>Alternative transport may be found in the form of taxis or personal transport services starting at<strong> 50 credits an hour</strong>. Public mass transit is the most economical and slowest option and includes speeder buses, sliding sidewalks, tube trams, and high-speed speeder trains. <strong>Weekly passes</strong> start at <strong>200 credits</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ad-hoc XP Award:</strong> If the characters acquire a<strong> Class III transponder</strong>, they receive experience equal to defeating a <strong>CR 12 encounter</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Contacting Tero Reskan</h3>\n<p>One of the first things the heroes should do is contact <strong>Tero Reskan.</strong> When they call the <strong>comlink code</strong> given to them by <strong>Captain Verana</strong>, an automated response asks them to leave a message. Once they do so, <strong>Tero</strong> returns the call but does not offer the secret sign. Instead, he waits for the heroes to say it (“<strong>We broke our droid</strong>”) and follows it up by giving the countersign (“<strong>I hope you meant to</strong>”). He then insists on meeting the heroes in person at a location of their choosing. He does not accompany them during the investigation, as he has other affairs to attend to, but he is available when needed for information.</p>\n<p><strong>Tero</strong> is a short, older, dark-skinned Human male with long white hair and a short trimmed beard. He is familiar with all levels of <strong>Coruscant</strong> and has contacts scattered around the planet. He looks at home in almost any setting. He wears a reversible cloak and carries a short cane, which he can alter to appear as a symbol of high <strong>Coruscant</strong> fashion (for when he visit the upper levels) or as a cheap stick (for when he is on the lower levels). His mannerisms also change subtly depending on his audience. He despises the Empire, blaming them for nationalizing his interstellar shipping business that used to run to the <strong>Deep Core</strong> and forcing him out. Use <strong>Tero</strong> to hint at other avenues of investigation when the heroes get stuck.</p>\n<h2>Following Leads</h2>\n<p>Each major lead is summarized below. Some may be achieved through the use of <strong>ability checks</strong> and require the heroes to search out certain contacts or locations. Visiting some levels of the city triggers certain encounters. See the encounter “<strong>@JournalEntry[PS55zPaBtf1XHl8R]{6-02 No Aliens}</strong>” when the heroes investigate the <strong>upper levels.</strong> Similarly, see “<strong>@JournalEntry[I7aH67PssXpEzgNf]{6-03 Rodian Fuming}</strong>” when they go to the lower levels of the factory sector known as the <strong>Works.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-left:3px solid var(--color-border-light-tertiary)\">\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> Encounters <strong>No Aliens</strong> and <strong>Rodian Fuming </strong>are referenced as included in the coversion text, but they haven't been included in the conversion. We have included simple conversions with basic, reskined statblocks from <em><strong>Scum and Villany</strong></em>. If a <strong>GM</strong> wishes, they could go back to the primary source material and give these conversions a more in-depth pass.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Failed <strong>ability checks</strong> or indiscreet investigations may alert the Imperials. Given the variety of methods the heroes may employ, you must judge if immediate Imperial involvement is warranted. Use the encounter “<strong>@JournalEntry[qTLM3QxFCfLN9iO8]{6-01 Rapid Response Force}</strong>” when immediate force is required; run it at least once during the adventure. General triggers are listed below, and specific triggers are listed in the <strong>ability checks</strong> included with each lead.</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> Heroes working with their own established <strong>contacts</strong> should not fear betrayal to Imperial authorities. However, there is always the possibility that an informant works with their contact, so the heroes should be discreet. <strong>Contacts</strong> can warn the heroes if they are not keeping a low profile.</p>\n<p><strong>The Force</strong>: Lesser uses of the <strong>Force,</strong> especially those out of public view, normally pass without notice. Using the <strong>Force</strong> around the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> may attract the attention of the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> (see below).</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information: </strong>Failing <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> tips off an Imperial informant. Failing a <strong>check</strong> by <strong>5 to 10 r</strong>esults in low-level suspicion among those from whom the hero attempts to gain information. Multiple failures at this level, or a single failure of<strong> more than 10</strong>, eventually alerts the <strong>ISB,</strong> which assigns an agent (use the agent from “<strong>@JournalEntry[NaCAfYeI8kmmMygm]{6-05 Imperial Pursuit, Part 1}</strong>”) to follow the characters. If the agent observes highly suspicious activity, he calls in an Imperial patrol (triggering the “<strong>@JournalEntry[qTLM3QxFCfLN9iO8]{6-01 Rapid Response Force}</strong>” encounter). Observant heroes should get a chance to notice and deal with the agent before he takes action.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology:</strong> The use of technology does not attract attention unless the characters devise a method of active surveillance or scanning that may be detected or observed. For instance, using sensors to scan a government building will alert Imperial systems, and a squad of <strong>Coruscant troopers</strong> are dispatched to the area to investigate immediately.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Computer:</strong> The public computer network on <strong>Coruscant</strong> is one of the most heavily monitored in the galaxy. Imperial government and military networks are notoriously difficult to slice. In either case, if the heroes fail an <strong>Intelligence (Technology)</strong> or <strong>Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong> when attempting to slice a <strong>hostile</strong> computer or fail by <strong>10 or more </strong>when attempting to slice an <strong>indifferent</strong> computer their connection is isolated and unusable for <strong>24 hours.</strong> An ISB agent (use the agent from “<strong>@JournalEntry[NaCAfYeI8kmmMygm]{6-05 Imperial Pursuit, Part 1}</strong>”) and a <strong>@Actor[iI6Rulqu8TCPm4BK]{Stormtrooper, Squad}</strong> are sent to investigate within <strong>10 minutes</strong> (or within <strong>5 minutes</strong> in a public place). Failing <strong>checks</strong> to access specific information will not trigger alerts unless multiple failures on a given subject are detected within an <strong>hour</strong> or from a single location over the <strong>course of a day</strong>.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" style=\"width:99.9%;border:none\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Access Point</span></strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:30.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Computer Attitude</span></strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50.0%;background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;mso-background-themetint:51;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Public terminal (including hotels, etc)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:30.0%;background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;mso-background-themetint:51;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Indifferent</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Public terminal with Imperial code cylinder</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:30.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Friendly</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50.0%;background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;mso-background-themetint:51;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Imperial terminal</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:30.0%;background:#FBE4D5;mso-background-themecolor:accent2;mso-background-themetint:51;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Hostile</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:50.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Imperial terminal with code cylinder</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width:30.0%;padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;text-align:center;line-height:normal\"><span style=\"font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Arial, sans-serif\">Indifferent</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Foundry Note:</strong> This handout provides an alternate organization of the information below.

He uses his prestigious ISB position to intimidate his targets. He is best known for <strong>“exposing”</strong> so-called alien plots to influence the <strong>Imperial Senate.</strong> It is widely believed by anti-Imperial activists that his investigations are at best massive distortions of the truth and at worst outright fabrications, but they are very effective in eliminating or arresting political dissenters.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> The truth is a little of both, especially when he arrests bureaucrats for discovering too much about matters related to the <strong>Sarlacc Project. Agent Dos’s</strong> priority is to prevent the discovery of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> by the <strong>Senate</strong> or anyone else. As such, he has extensive contact with the <strong>Inquisitors,</strong> and the access codes to the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> are stored in his <em>@Compendium[sw5e.adventuringgear.g1khCbcSlJbQ4CLZ]{Code cylinder}</em>—something the heroes will eventually discover they need to access the building.</p>\n<p><strong>Dos</strong> is brash, arrogant, and prideful. He enjoys using his position and power, and he is much sneakier than some give him credit for. He uses his reputation and visibility to his <strong>advantage.</strong> Because he has become recognizable in some circles, he uses a stand-in when working undercover to give himself an extra layer of protection. He’s currently working anti-alien leads in the <strong>Outlander Club,</strong> and he can be found there most evenings.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation methods:</strong> The heroes can learn about <strong>Dos</strong> in a number of ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts: Tero</strong> or another contact can give the basics on <strong>Dos</strong> because his exploits show up on the local newsnets from time to time.</p>\n<p><strong>The Force</strong>: Reaching out through the <strong>Force</strong> through using a <strong>Force power</strong> or class feature exposes nothing until the heroes meet <strong>Dos</strong> in person, and by then it will be too late unless they lose him in the chase in the \"<strong>@JournalEntry[Cq0AqqNmAi1wFoVX]{6-04 Outlanders}</strong>\" encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> A<strong> DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> using generally available sources reveals the basics about <strong>Dos</strong> (described above) and takes <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong>. A <strong>DC 23 check</strong> and <strong>5,000 credits</strong> in bribes to low-level officials or underworld information brokers reveals that <strong>Dos</strong> often is found in the <strong>Outlander Club</strong> in the evenings. The check takes <strong>[[/r 2d6[hours] # Time]]</strong>. When the heroes pursue him to the club, see the encounter “<strong>@JournalEntry[Cq0AqqNmAi1wFoVX]{6-04 Outlanders}</strong>”.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology:</strong> There is no way to track <strong>Dos</strong> through technology, unless the heroes are able to tap into the <strong>Outlander</strong> security system or otherwise locate and follow him from there.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Computers:</strong> On a public system, a <strong>DC 16 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> reveals the basics in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. A <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> takes <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> and reveals speculation among low-profile dissidents that <strong>Dos</strong> is protecting something big, though they don’t know what. The search also turns up a picture of <strong>Dos</strong> at the <strong>Outlander,</strong> stashed away in a copy of a defunct city entertainment newsnet, <strong>Talkstar One.</strong> It turns out that the newsnet was ordered shut down the day after the picture was released in its last update for <strong>“security”</strong> reasons. On an Imperial network, a <strong>DC 27 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> reveals <strong>Lt. Dos’s</strong> investigation of suspected alien dissidents at the <strong>Outlander.</strong></p>\n<h2>Protocol Droid CZ-3T6</h2>\n<p><strong>The Basics:</strong> <strong>CZ-3T6</strong> is an unremarkable CZ-series communications droid that served for many years in the Republic Senate’s master communications center. <strong>3T</strong> was one of hundreds of droids routing and organizing Senate communications of all types. When the <strong>Senate</strong> was reorganized into the <strong>Imperial Senate,</strong> the communications center was revamped, and <strong>CZ-3T6</strong> was reassigned.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> <strong>3T</strong> now controls the main communications node in <strong>Imeici Spire.</strong> The droid was selected due to its <strong>Senate</strong> communications center experience, which it now uses to help cover up the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and the <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> actions in general. There is no way to contact the droid other than at <strong>Imeici Spire.</strong> The <strong>droid</strong> is loyal to its masters, and selective memory wipes keep it from developing too much of a personality while allowing it to retain its vast knowledge of senatorial contacts, their habits, and their methods. Getting to <strong>3T</strong> isn’t actually required. He is a weakness in the Imperial bureaucracy, and tracking him down will lead the heroes to the <strong>Spire’s</strong> location, which they may deduce is that of the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> If the heroes seek him out on level <strong>188</strong> of <strong>Imeici Spire,</strong> he proves to be an efficient, loyal droid that mindwipes itself and the communications node rather than let its information fall into the heroes’ hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation Methods:</strong> The heroes can learn about <strong>CZ-3T6</strong> in a number of ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> None of the heroes’ contacts knows <strong>3T.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Force</strong>: Reaching out through the <strong>Force</strong> through using a <strong>Force power</strong> or class feature reveals nothing about the <strong>droid</strong> unless the heroes meet it in person, after which any attempt through class feature or <strong>Force power</strong> will reveal the basics and secrets listed above.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information Check: 3T</strong> is unknown to available sources. A<strong> DC 24 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> taking<strong> [[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> reveals that Republic governmental departments frequently used CZ units, but many were reassigned when newer units were phased in shortly after the Empire’s establishment. Once the name Droid Services is known, a <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> reveals the location of the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology:</strong> There is no way to track <strong>3T</strong> directly through technology available to the heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Computers:</strong> A <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> reveals the basics in <strong>10 minutes</strong>. A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> that takes <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong>  reveals that all CZ units from the Republic Senate were handed over to a government contractor simply named <strong>Droid Services </strong>for refurbishment and reassignment. A <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> taking <strong>5 minutes</strong> reveals that the company is located in the <strong>upper levels</strong> in the <strong>Collective Commerce District</strong>, better known as <strong>CoCo Town.</strong></p>\n<p>Access to <strong>Droid Services</strong> may be attempted remotely. A<strong> DC 20 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check </strong>must be made to connect remotely. If successful, the computer treats the hero as <strong>hostile.</strong> A <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check</strong> can be made to change the computer’s attitude, but failure causes the system to break the connection. Since <strong>Droid Services</strong> is a commercial (not Imperial) facility, authorities are not alerted unless three attempts are failed. If that occurs, an <strong>ISB agent</strong> and a <strong>squad of stormtroopers</strong> are sent <strong>12 hours </strong>later to the heroes’ location to investigate.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes are able to access a friendly system, a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check </strong>reveals that <strong>3T</strong> was refurbished at <strong>Droid Services</strong> and assigned to a government communications node in the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> <strong>four months ago</strong>. Unlike droids reassigned to other government offices, <strong>CZ-3T6</strong> was removed from the company’s service contract immediately after delivery, and no further information is available.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Droid Services</strong></p>\n<p>If the heroes investigate <strong>Droid Services</strong> in person, they find an enormous, well-kept, multistory industrial building with thousands of droids being refurbished at any given time. Security is tight, with private security patrols backed up by sensor-based alarm systems.</p>\n<p>The staff at the <strong>Droid Services Customer Satisfaction</strong> office is willing to discuss general information about the place and its droids. They will not willingly reveal privileged client information, such as the assignment of specific droids. Such information can be accessed through their computer system, assuming the heroes gain access to a terminal. When the computer is accessed from within the building, it treats all users as <strong>indifferent </strong>or <strong>friendly.</strong> In this manner, it is possible to learn all of the information described under <strong>Use Computers</strong>. (for <strong>Protocol Droid CZ-3T6</strong>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Resh</h2>\n<p><strong>The Basics: Resh</strong> is one tough Sullustan. Stocky, mean-spirited, and aggressive, <strong>Resh</strong> was a trusted lieutenant of <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. After <strong>Darga’s</strong> death, <strong>Resh</strong> attempted to take control of the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> organization on <strong>Coruscant,</strong> but it quickly fell apart. Wanted by both the Empire and <strong>Darga’s</strong> old enemies, <strong>Resh</strong> hired himself out as an independent enforcer. Recently, he has dropped from view, leaving some to speculate that he finally found a way to smuggle himself off the planet.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> With the death of <strong>Darga</strong> and the collapse of his organization, <strong>Resh</strong> discovered that he had little to no influence, and his Imperial contacts dropped him. <strong>Resh</strong> became paranoid when an Imperial bounty of <strong>10,000 credits</strong> was placed on him a <strong>few months ago</strong>. He is hiding in the <strong>lowest levels</strong> of the factory sector known as the <strong>Works</strong> and searching for someone to smuggle him off the planet through information brokers, primarily <strong>Eetoa Ro.</strong> They also alert him of anyone looking for him. After the heroes meet <strong>Eetoa Ro</strong> and attempt to meet with <strong>Resh</strong> in person, run the encounter “@JournalEntry[3vQ3jyYaWxDExCo4]{6-07 The Works Labyrinth}”, followed by the encounter “@JournalEntry[gIQBeKp2NPnCbC2n]{6-08 Resh's Warehouse}”.</p>\n<p><strong>Resh</strong> communicated with the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> through a droid at a specific <strong>commlink number,</strong> but the link has been disabled. He knows that the ISB actively hides the <strong>project,</strong> partially through <strong>Agent Lesan Dos,</strong> who has considerable access. He also knows that <strong>Darga</strong> once told him that the entire operation was to move into a new building called <strong>Imeici Spire,</strong> now under construction in <strong>CoCo Town.</strong> He bets that <strong>Agent Dos</strong> has access to the building with his <strong>code cylinder. Resh</strong> believes the project is run by a secret Imperial department, but he doesn’t know who it might be. If the heroes ask about <strong>Inquisitors,</strong> he says the only one he ever knew about was <strong>Valin Draco,</strong> but he fears that others may find him. He will not help the heroes enter the building and refers all requests for other materials or contacts to <strong>Eetoa Ro.</strong> He wants nothing to do with the project and wants to get the heroes away from him as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation methods: </strong>The heroes can learn about <strong>Resh</strong> in a number of ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts:</strong> After <strong>24 hours</strong> of investigation, a contact in the <strong>Coruscant</strong> underworld directs them to information broker <strong>Eetoa Ro.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Force:</strong> <span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Reaching out through the </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Force</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> through using a </span><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Force power</strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> or class feature can't locate <strong>Resh</strong> directly.

A <strong>DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> taking <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> reveals <strong>Resh’s</strong> basics and the Imperial bounty on him. An additional <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> taking<strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> puts the heroes in contact with information broker <strong>Eetoa Ro.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Technology:</strong> There is no way to track <strong>Resh</strong> through technology unless the heroes locate his direct <strong>commlink number.</strong> With that, they may attempt to track his movements to his <strong>commlink.</strong> However, to do so, they must gain access to the <strong>Works</strong> area <strong>commlink network,</strong> which requires a <strong>DC 22 Intelligence (slicer's kit) check </strong>to access the network’s controllers remotely, then a <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (slicer's kit)</strong> to locate <strong>Resh.</strong> If successful, it shows he is in the <strong>Works</strong> hideout. If unsuccessful, Imperial authorities are alerted, and a <strong>Coruscant @JournalEntry[qTLM3QxFCfLN9iO8]{Rapid Response Force}</strong> is sent to the heroes’ location, arriving <strong>5 minutes</strong> after the attempt fails.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Computers: </strong>News and records on <strong>Resh</strong> are few. A<strong> DC 19 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> taking <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> reveals that a<strong> 10,000-credit </strong>bounty has been posted by the Empire for capturing <strong>Resh</strong> dead or alive. It also reveals a local newsnet story reporting a dramatic public shootout between “<strong>an unknown Sullustan and a criminal gang</strong>” in the lower levels of the <strong>Works.</strong> The attached video clip shows the <strong>Sullustan</strong> (presumably <strong>Resh)</strong> brazenly charging and gunning down a small gang of Humans in just a<strong> few seconds</strong>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Eetoa Ro</strong></p>\n<p>Although only in his late teens, the fast-talking, self-confident <strong>Eetoa</strong> is enormously street smart and has vast knowledge of the <strong>Works</strong> underworld.</p>\n<p><strong>Eetoa</strong> may be reached by <em>commlink</em> to arrange a meeting. He directs the heroes to the landing platform of the <strong>Galaxy IV Coolant Refinery</strong>, which has been abandoned for decades. When they arrive at the large, rusty platform, <strong>Eetoa</strong> appears from behind decrepit equipment and zips up to them on an unarmed, banged-up speeder bike (use the statistics for the @Actor[dL4LcIslOexojlAN]{Aratech 74-Z}). He wears a red and blue flight suit that is faded and torn. He negotiates from the speeder bike while the engine is running. If he feels threatened, he zips off at high speed, using his knowledge of the area to lose his pursuers in the refinery’s tangled pipes and passageways.</p>\n<p><strong>Eetoa</strong> is cashing in on both sides. <strong>Resh</strong> is paying him to arrange passage off the planet; however, <strong>Eetoa</strong> also charges the heroes <strong>5,000 credits</strong> (starting) for information. His attitude begins as <strong>indifferent.</strong> He tells them that <strong>Resh</strong> needs a way off the planet, and if the heroes convince <strong>Eetoa</strong> that they can help (and pay the fee), he gives them <strong>Resh’s</strong> location at a warehouse hideout deep within the <strong>Works Labyrinth</strong> (see the encounter “@JournalEntry[3vQ3jyYaWxDExCo4]{6-07 The Works Labyrinth}”). For an additional <strong>500 credits</strong>, he’ll also let them know that bounty hunters are looking for <strong>Resh.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[A3BzY5Ua3gq86NfP]{Eetoa Ro}</strong></p>\n<h2>The Imeici Spire</h2>\n<p><strong>The Basics: </strong>The <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> is a<strong> 200-story</strong> tower clad in black glass and metal at one end of the high level <strong>Crystalline Plaza</strong>—or at least, it will be, once completed. Right now, the tower is an exposed framework of alloy and ultracrete structure. It is unusual in that levels seem to be completed from the top down, rather than the bottom up. The upper <strong>14 levels</strong> appear almost complete, but only the bottom <strong>5 levels </strong>appear to have an exterior skin. The remaining levels are much less finished. The official explanation is that the upper levels had to be completed first to allow for the immediate installation of skylane control and Imperial communications equipment. The <strong>Spire</strong> will house Imperial departments of lesser importance, as well as <strong>CoCo Town </strong>governmental offices, plus some ISB and COMPNOR offices.</p>\n<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> Although the building will include new offices, it already has specialized facilities specific to the <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> needs. Their levels are already in use, exclusively for the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The security around the building is relatively discrete for a new Imperial structure, but it is very tight on the <strong>Inquisitor</strong> levels. However, with some investigation, the heroes should be able to discover the building’s vulnerabilities. See @JournalEntry[8eiKZfL9AjkwIZ5g]{Part 3} for additional information.</p>\n<p><strong>Investigation methods: </strong>The heroes can learn about the <strong>Imeici Spire</strong> in a number of ways.</p>\n<p><strong>Contacts: Tero Reskan</strong> and other contacts know the location of the <strong>Spire</strong> but believe it to be simply a cog in the bureaucratic Imperial machine.</p>\n<p><strong>The Force: Force</strong> sensitive characters automatically sense a disturbance in the <strong>Force</strong> when within <strong>half a mile</strong> of the building. The <strong>Inquisitors’</strong> activities have tainted the tower, adding to the sense of unease felt by many who work on or near the building. Using the <strong>Force</strong> in this area is very dangerous. The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are on constant watch for any remaining <strong>Jedi</strong> or other <strong>Force</strong> users and they regularly try to sense <strong>Force</strong> users in the area. When this occurs (no more than <strong>twice a day</strong>), <strong>Force-sensitive</strong> characters in the area must make a <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Deception) or Charisma (Deception) check</strong>. If they fail, the <strong>Inquisitors</strong> become aware of the presence of <strong>Force</strong> sensitives and are prepared for them when they are encountered later in the adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> A casual investigation reveals the location and basics of the tower in <strong>30 minutes</strong>. A <strong>DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong>, which takes <strong>[[/r 1d6[hours] # Time]]</strong> and requires <strong>2,000 credits</strong> in bribes, reveals that many believe the building is to be used for other purposes once construction is complete. Speculation is rampant, but some believe the ISB has something to do with it. The construction workers are sworn to secrecy, but rumors abound about secret deliveries made late at night to the building site. A <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> (along with <strong>5,000 credits</strong> in bribes to construction workers) gives the heroes a good description of the building material staging area and some ideas about how to access it. The check also reveals that they must have the proper code cylinder to move through the tower itself, and construction worker cylinders won’t access the completed levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Using modified scanners or receivers, the heroes may be able to detect transmissions in the suspected <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> frequency range when within<strong> 3 miles</strong> and line of sight of the building. They must make a<strong> DC 30 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to detect the broadcast; heroes who are proficient in <strong>slicer's kits</strong> have <strong>advantage</strong> on this check. Once the heroes detect the transmissions, they may pinpoint the broadcast from the communications array at the top of the <strong>Spire.</strong> The transmission is encoded in a manner completely alien to even the most skilled slicers.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Computers:</strong> At a public terminal, a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> reveals the location and basics of the tower in <strong>5 minutes</strong>. Schematics and building plans are restricted, as they are with all Imperial buildings. At an Imperial terminal, they can confirm that the ISB is heavily involved with the <strong>Spire,</strong> and they can learn about future plans for completing the remaining levels, but they discover nothing about the upper levels.</p>\n<h3>Accessing Imeici Spire</h3>\n<p>Investigating the tower turns up two possible entry points: the upper construction delivery zone at <strong>level 185</strong>, and the construction HQ at plaza level.</p>\n<p>The heroes must choose how to enter the <strong>Spire.</strong> They may try to infiltrate the building by disguising themselves. All workers require special passes and only approved speeders are allowed to approach and land. Contacts such as <strong>Eetoa Ro</strong> and <strong>Tero Reskan</strong> can point them to <strong>Core Craft</strong> as the primary contractor and supplier on the project, which enables the heroes to get the required passes and equipment. Ultimately, they will probably choose to land at <strong>level 185</strong>, which is closer to their final goal.</p>\n<p>If the heroes try to disguise themselves as <strong>Imperial agents</strong>, <strong>stormtroopers,</strong> or <strong>Coruscant guards</strong>, they discover that they must bluff their way past the construction workers if they don’t have the proper codes. They also may be challenged by other Imperials that they meet along the way, risking discovery because they won’t know the proper protocols or current standing orders.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-style:italic\"><strong>Note: </strong>Completing all investigations should be considered a level-up milestone.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Ad-Hoc Exp Award</h3>\n<p>Heroes who successfully obtain information on the four primary subjects of investigation <strong>(ISB Agent Dos, protocol droid CZ-3T6, Resh,</strong> and the <strong>Imeici Spire)</strong> receive experience points equal to defeating a <strong>CR 13 encounter</strong> for each success (a total of four <strong>CR 13 encounters</strong>).

{"_id":"tPpsJRmWJA1y2hzu","name":"Part 1: A Bold Plan","content":"<h1>Part 1: A Bold Plan</h1>\n<p>After speaking with <strong>Bail Organa </strong>at the conclusion of the previous adventure, the heroes are directed to meet up with <strong>Lady Alya Aldrete.</strong> They find her at a rendezvous point in space, outside a massive gas cloud where she has amassed a small armada of ships. The rendezvous point is only <strong>two hours</strong> away via hyperspace, still well within the <strong>Deep Core</strong> <strong>Security Zone,</strong> and <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> communications officer transmits a hyperspace route for the heroes to follow that will get them there safely. As the heroes approach the rendezvous point, describe the other vessels here as a rag-tag collection of tramp freighters, modified bulk haulers, a few Clone Wars-era capital ships, and an overall motley assortment of vessels that look vastly different from the pristine ships of the Empire.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Lady Aldrete</strong> invites the heroes to dock on her flagship, a heavily modified Corellian gunship. As the deck crew sets to refueling and restocking their ship (or ships), the heroes are shown to temporary quarters and allowed to refresh themselves. Once suitably rested and cleaned up, they are invited to join <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> in the ship's command bridge to discuss the next step.</p>\n<h2>Lady Aldrete's Briefing</h2>\n<p><strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> welcomes the heroes into her ship's <strong>command bridge,</strong> where she and some other rough-looking ship <strong>captains</strong> are quietly talking next to a holographic display that looks positively chaotic from a distance. The heroes also spot two familiar faces—<strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> and <strong>Captain Sirona Okeefe</strong>, who seem to be deep in their own conversation. As the heroes approach, they realize that the display shows a single, massive planet around which hundreds, if not thousands, of ships and space stations can be seen in continuous orbit.</p>\n<p>When the heroes step up to the projector, <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> ends her conversation and turns to them. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>\"My dear friends,\" says Lady Aldrete, a look of pity in her eyes. \"It is good to see you alive. Bail told me about Master Denia—she will be sorely missed.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"I'm afraid that we have little time for mourning. Too many lives have already been sacrificed to stop now. While you were traveling to Prakith, I sent out the call for all of my contacts in the Deep Core to come to me, and one of them brought some very timely data. We have not only discovered the location of the Sarlacc Project above the planet Byss, but we have also obtained a full readout of the vessel's defenders, and we know that the Sarlacc Project, while not yet complete, is within weeks of being so.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"What I have proposed to my captains is a mission to destroy the prototype. We've got enough ships to distract its defenders, but we can't hope to beat them and destroy the ship—just survive. What we need is someone to take control of their defenses and turn them against the prototype. You're our best, and probably only, hope for that.\"</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With that, <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> begins outlining what little they have of their plan. First, the smuggler fleet will jump into the <strong>Beshqek</strong> system and engage the <strong>Sarlacc Project's</strong> defenses. Then, while feigning a retreat, they will draw the defenders away from the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> and its <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong>. The heroes' strike team will then infiltrate the platform, seize control of its weapon complement, and turn the weapons on the <strong>Sarlacc Project. </strong>Undefended, it shouldn't take long for the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> to become so much debris drifting into the atmosphere of <strong>Byss.</strong> The heroes and the smuggler fleet will then retreat and jump to lightspeed, leaving <strong>Byss</strong> far behind.</p>\n<h2>The Calm Before the Storm</h2>\n<p>Of course, heroes being what they are, they might have some alternative plans they would like to enact. <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> plan is left somewhat vague intentionally, and if the players show some initiative, you should let them fill in the gaps or even rebuild the plan from the ground up. Of course, allowing them to do so will alter the way this adventure plays out, but given the fact that this is the climax of the <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign, feel free to let the players concoct a better plan if they see fit.</p>\n<p>The two most important parts of the plan, and the two events around which this adventure is engineered, are taking control of the <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong> and flying into the superstructure of the <strong>Super Star Destroyer </strong>to take out its <strong>main reactor</strong>. When the heroes are cooking up their plan, keep in mind that, in general, those two events need to happen, and they must take place in that order.</p>\n<p>Naturally, this adventure cannot cover every eventuality or plan that the heroes might come up with, but the following information should help you determine whether they succeed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> is a <strong>Super Star Destroyer </strong>that has not yet reached completion. Many of its systems are still offline, but (unknown to <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> and the heroes) its engines, life support, and weapons are online.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> is defended by a <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong>. However, something the heroes do not know is that the platform also acts as a stabilizer by using its incredibly powerful tractor beams. The upshot is that the platform anchors the <strong>Super Star Destroyer </strong>in place; as long as the tractor beams are active, it cannot move.</li>\n<li>The <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> is ragged, but well defended and captained by some of the best in the galaxy. Given the fact that the <strong>defense forces</strong> around <strong>Byss</strong> are not quite up to what they will be by the time of the Rebel Alliance, the <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> can survive about <strong>20 minutes</strong> of direct fire, plus another <strong>20 minutes</strong> during the faux retreat. If <strong>starfighters</strong> take part in the conflict, the <strong>fleet</strong> can survive for another <strong>10 minutes</strong> during both the initial assault and the retreat.</li>\n<li>Even when the <strong>main defense forces</strong> pursue the <strong>smuggler fleet,</strong> a small number (mostly <strong>starfighters</strong> and <strong>Skipray blastboats)</strong> will stay behind. However, good piloting might allow a ship to avoid notice by more than one patrol.</li>\n<li><strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> has a number of <strong>slicers</strong> that can alter a starship's <strong>IFF transponders</strong> and other <strong>transmitters</strong> to disguise a <strong>small number of ships </strong>as Imperial vessels. This won't stand up to closer visual inspection, but it should fool <strong>sensors.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Admiral Varth</strong> is commanding the skeleton crew currently operating the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. When the <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> appears, he immediately suspects a trap and begins ordering the crew on the <strong>defense platform</strong> to begin emergency shutdown procedures of their tractor beams. However, due to the high power being pumped through the beams, shutting them down is a lengthy process—upward of <strong>30 minutes</strong> if all protocols are observed.</li>\n<li><strong>Inquisitor Draco</strong> has retreated to <strong>Byss,</strong> where his time spent in dark meditation has revealed that he will face his final conflict with the heroes. With <strong>Admiral Varth's</strong> blessing, <strong>Draco</strong> has placed himself in charge of the defense platform, and he believes that once he defeats the heroes and crushes <strong>Alderaan's resistance,</strong> he will be given command of the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and its associated fleet. He has not warned <strong>Varth</strong> of his visions. Instead, <strong>Draco</strong> plans to step in and save the day when <strong>Varth</strong> would have failed, thus removing the <strong>Admiral</strong> as a rival for control of the Emperor's greatest fleet.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Golan platform</strong> is manned mostly by droids. <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>did not trust Humans to operate his prize ship's defenses, although he has allowed a complement of the Emperor's hand-picked agents to occupy the station for defense.</li>\n<li><strong>Varth</strong> will order the <strong>defense fleet</strong> to pursue the <strong>smugglers,</strong> hoping that they will be crushed by his ships. However, <strong>Admiral Varth </strong>is no fool, and he would not leave the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> unprotected if it weren't defensible on its own. <strong>Varth</strong> believes (and rightly so) that the<strong> Super Star Destroyer,</strong> although incomplete, is still powerful enough to obliterate the <strong>smuggler's ships</strong> on its own.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One way or another, a large chunk of the ship's hull will be ripped away, exposing the interior superstructure and providing access to the <strong>main reactor.</strong> Although this can happen in several ways (see <strong>@JournalEntry[vqCpHKeHEuTUIW02]{Part 3}</strong> of the adventure), the heroes might come up with their own plan to gain access to the core.</p>\n<h2>Getting to the Golan</h2>\n<p>Once the heroes have a plan, the mission can begin. <strong>Captains Okeefe</strong> and <strong>Verana</strong> are both taking part in the mission. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> will command <strong>Blue Squadron</strong>, a collection of <strong>starfighters</strong> cobbled together from the various smuggler crews, while <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> will serve as <strong>Verana's</strong> wingman and executive officer. <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> will lead her ship and the rest of the <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> into battle. The heroes have a chance to say their goodbyes, then it is time for leaving.</p>\n<p>When the heroes depart, they make the short jump to hyperspace to the planet <strong>Byss.</strong> Upon arrival, they find everything going according to plan. The <strong>smuggler fleet</strong> is occupying the ships defending the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> giving the heroes a clear shot at the <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong>. Read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>Before your eyes hovers the oddly colored planet of Byss, its orange land masses and purple oceans casting the cockpit in an eerie glow.

Unfortunately, being spotted by one is nearly unavoidable. A small patrol, consisting of a few elite <strong>TIE fighters</strong>, is on a course that will intersect with the heroes. If the heroes have taken precautions against being detected, play them out. Otherwise, the patrol spots the heroes' ship and attacks.

The majority of the heavy fire is being concentrated on the last of the <strong>Corellian Corvettes,</strong> and the majority of the enemy <strong>TIE fighters</strong> are tangling with the <strong>loyalist starfighters.</strong> Docking can be accomplished only via a docking tunnel, similar to the one that the <strong><em>Millennium Falcon</em></strong> used to dock with the <em><strong>Redemption</strong></em> at the end of <em><strong>The Empire Strikes Back</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>The docking tunnel leads to the capital ship’s interior. Chaos is everywhere as lights flash and klaxons blare. Bodies of the crew litter the corridors, punctuated by the corpse of an occasional <strong>stormtrooper.</strong> Some corridors are impassable, requiring the heroes to double back and look for other means of access. A list of possible <strong>hazards</strong> faced by the heroes includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A climb up (or down) a malfunctioning turbolift to gain access to an upper (or lower) level.</li>\n<li>Passing through a corridor that is swinging with live power cables.</li>\n<li>Moving through a sealed compartment that has recently been exposed to open space, or within which life support systems have failed.</li>\n<li>Occasional turbulence caused by incoming turbolaser fire from the Star Destroyers.</li>\n<li>Areas that have no power and are completely dark.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, the ship occasionally rocks as another wave of turbolaser fire hits the hull. All characters on the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> must succeed on a <strong>DC 17 Dexterity check</strong> or be knocked prone when you decide this effect occurs.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the <strong>hazards,</strong> the trip to the command deck of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> is tense. Though the heroes encounter no Imperial troops, the occasional dead or mortally wounded <strong>stormtrooper</strong> is proof that troops are somewhere nearby.

Although they aren’t bound, the <strong>prisoners</strong> are keenly aware of the weapons pointed at them by their captors. Their future looks bleaker by the moment—the only thing they have to look forward to is an interrogation followed by imprisonment or death</p>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[zdWBH24DkKjzYub8]{7-07 A Line of Prisoners}</p>\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>Any <strong>prisoners</strong> rescued are extremely grateful.

They’re not experienced combatants, but their enthusiasm makes up for this shortcoming.</p>\n<p>Given enough time, the surviving crew might become important friends and contacts for the heroes, depending on how they are treated.</p>\n<h2>Victory and Loss</h2>\n<p>With the bulk of the ship’s corridors behind them, the heroes finally make their way to the <strong><em>Resurgence’s</em></strong> docking bay. It is filled with debris and a large number of fallen crew members. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Two Imperial shuttles sit upon the floor of the landing bay, the black expanse of space visible through the shielded opening behind them.

They might be able to rescue a handful of other crew members first, but time is growing increasingly short.</p>\n<p>If the pilot of the remaining Imperial shuttle sees the last of the <strong>naval troopers</strong> fall, he retracts his boarding ramp and takes off, maneuvering out into open space.</p>\n<p>The heroes and any of their surviving companions need to make their way back to their ship to escape. As they do so, the intensity of the bombardment from the Star Destroyers increases by a large margin. It’s obvious that with Draco and his <strong>prisoners</strong> no longer aboard, the rebel frigate has outlived its usefulness.</p>\n<h2>Leaving the <em>Resurgence</em> Behind</h2>\n<p>When the heroes return to their ship, it is an emotional time for the remaining crew of the <em><strong>Resurgence.</strong></em> Their home is being systematically destroyed by Imperial turbolaser fire. The last <strong>Corellian Corvette,</strong> by some miracle of fate or luck, is limping away from the fray with a number of <strong>TIE fighters</strong> in hot pursuit. <strong>Captain Verana</strong> is beside himself but does his best to comfort his crew despite his own grief.</p>\n<p>The rest of the <strong><em>Resurgence’s</em></strong> surviving fleet is gone, having entered hyperspace while the heroes were aboard their flagship. The only thing that remains is for the heroes to escape.

Despite your persistence, as well as your luck, you must admit that you are outmatched. Shut down your engines and prepare to be boarded.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> is full of bluster and threat, but the truth is that he can do nothing to stop the heroes from making their escape. If engaged in conversation, <strong>Varth</strong> reveals little of his involvement in the plot other than saying, “<em><strong>Had you not proven so talented, none of this would have been necessary.</strong></em>” If questioned about his apparent defection, he can’t suppress a smirk as he casually mentions how easy it was to fool the heroes and the others.</p>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> entertains conversation only as long as it remains civil or worthwhile. He signs off by saying, “<em><strong>I’m sure we will meet again.</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2>Concluding the Adventure</h2>\n<p>Some time passes between the heroes making the jump into hyperspace and their rendezvous with what remains of the <strong>Rebel fleet.</strong> Ultimately, they must report to <strong>Bail Organa</strong> concerning all that has occurred in the past few days. <strong>Organa</strong> meets with the heroes personally, congratulating each of them on a job well done despite the odds that were against them and the price that was paid.</p>\n<p>When everyone is present, <strong>Organa</strong> makes the following short speech:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“We’ve paid a heavy price for the information you’ve managed to gather.

This adventure lets the players take part in the famous <strong>Cloud City Sabacc Tournament</strong> (the same tournament in which, years later, <strong>Han Solo</strong> will win the <em><strong>Millennium Falcon</strong></em> from <strong>Lando Calrissian)</strong> and the players should advance to <strong>7th level</strong> by the end of the adventure.</p>\n<p>Over the course of this adventure, the players will discover that there is more to this tournament than is apparent on the surface, and that it is being used to cover a transaction between <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> and the evil Galactic Empire. This adventure is the final part of the story arc that makes up the first chapter in the<strong> Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign. After the adventure, the players should have some much-needed downtime.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0000\"><strong>Note from the Foundry Conversion Team:</strong> This adventure was written long before the story of <strong>Han</strong> and <strong>Lando</strong> was canonized on film. In <em><strong>Solo: A Star Wars Story</strong></em> we see that the card game actually took place on <strong>Numidian Prime.</strong> (The name of the planet comes from secondary materials, such as the novelization, but it clearly isn't <strong>Cloud City.)</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Adventure Background</h2>\n<p>This adventure is designed assuming that you have run your players through the first two <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>adventures, <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em> and <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>. The players should be familiar with <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong> and know that he is involved with the Empire. The players should know he has been trading resources used for a clandestine Imperial operation known as the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong> The players also know that <strong>Darga </strong>has fled to the planet <strong>Bespin,</strong> and that finding him is the key to discovering more about the <strong>Sarlacc Project.</strong></p>\n<p>If you aren’t running <strong>Dawn of Defiance</strong> but would like to use this adventure in your home campaign, the adventure can be adapted to get the players involved in other ways. The players might be hired by another crime lord to seek out <strong>Darga </strong>and figure out what he’s been doing with the Empire, or the players could be working for a law enforcement agency that believes that <strong>Darga </strong>is engaging in illegal activities with the Empire’s approval.</p>\n<h4>Adventure Summary</h4>\n<p>By the time the players arrive on <strong>Bespin,</strong> <strong>Darga </strong>is firmly secluded on <strong>Cloud City</strong>, and his luxury yacht is hidden. When the players begin their search for him, most of the usual avenues turn up nothing—the <strong>Hutt</strong> has paid his associates handsomely to keep him hidden, and none would jeopardize their health and wealth to reveal his location to anyone.</p>\n<p>The players’ only lead comes when they learn that <strong>Cloud City</strong> will be holding a major <strong>sabacc tournament</strong> in a matter of days, and that it is rumored that an <strong>Imperial officer</strong> will be arriving to participate. Rumor has it that this <strong>officer</strong> is in the pocket of<strong> Darga the Hutt</strong>, and that his participation in the <strong>tournament</strong> is merely a cover-up for a clandestine meeting between them. If the players can infiltrate the card game, they might have a chance to question the <strong>Imperial officer</strong> or <strong>Darga’s </strong>agent about the <strong>Hutt’s</strong> whereabouts—but first they must get into the game, which is by invitation only. The <strong>tournament</strong> takes place and, if the players do well, they find themselves face-to-face with <strong>Darga’s </strong>agent.</p>\n<p>The players also discover that the reason for the <strong>officer’s</strong> visit was not only to play in the <strong>tournament</strong> but also to deliver payment for the biggest shipment of <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> yet. In addition, the payment for the <strong>gas</strong> is unusual as well: the officer brought an entire transport ship full of <strong>slaves</strong> to trade to the <strong>Hutt.</strong> The vessel with the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> was launched before the <strong>tournament</strong> started, and the <strong>slave</strong> ship remains in orbit, having been brought to the system earlier.</p>\n<p>The players discover that <strong>Darga </strong>has been hiding in a hangar in the underside of <strong>Cloud City.</strong> When the players arrive, they face a combined force of <strong>Darga’s </strong>minions and a small detachment of Imperial <strong>stormtroopers</strong>. <strong>Darga </strong>makes a stand and engages the players in combat (or at least, his minions do, while the <strong>Hutt</strong> prods them from the back of the chamber). After <strong>Darga</strong> is defeated, the players learn that the Empire has set the cruiser carrying <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> on a collision course with the slave ship, eliminating the two biggest pieces of evidence of their deal, which has now gone sour thanks to the players’ intervention.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the players still have a chance to stop the collision. Inside the hangar are a number of brand-new <strong>Z-95 Headhunter starfighters,</strong> and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> arrives within moments to pick up any players who do not wish to fly their own <strong>starfighters.</strong> As they reach low orbit, the players can see the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> carrier blazing toward the slave ship. Unfortunately, the dagger-shaped form of a <strong>Star Destroyer </strong>appears out of hyperspace bearing down on the players. The players must race to destroy the ship carrying the <strong>Tibanna gas</strong> before it can crash into the slave ship, fending off <strong>TIE fighters</strong> at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Opening Crawl</h2>\n<p>For Gamemasters who wish to have an opening crawl before the adventure, consider using the boxed text below.</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[ouAd7mWOxoy4njlK]{Opening Crawl}</p>","folder":"wQGnE4SfZDo5S84I","sort":100000,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"vqCpHKeHEuTUIW02","name":"Part 3: Into the Sarlacc","content":"<h1>Part 3: Into the Sarlacc</h1>\n<p>Once the heroes are back outside the <strong>Golan Defense Platform</strong>, they receive some disturbing news from <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> ship. The <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> has appeared in the middle of the battle and is devastating the smuggler <strong>fleet.</strong> Unfortunately, the ship was able to make a precise microjump thanks to an <strong>interdiction vessel</strong> in the middle of the battle, which yanked the ship out of hyperspace and is also currently preventing the smugglers from making the jump to lightspeed and escaping. The smuggler fleet is being slaughtered by the overwhelming firepower of the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> has ordered the fleet into a defensive formation, and starfighters have been launched to attack the <strong>interdicting vessel,</strong> but the situation looks grim.</p>\n<p>However, depending on how the heroes did at the end of <strong>@JournalEntry[56bS5PGxM7SsbIgB]{Part 2}</strong>, there might be a chance for survival. If they succeeded at returning the <strong>platform's tractor beams</strong> to full power, they discover that a huge chunk of the <strong>Sarlacc Project's</strong> still-under-construction superstructure has been ripped free, exposing the interior of the ship to space. <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> tactical advisors have concocted a reckless plan to pull their starfighters back from the attack on the <strong>interdictor</strong> and redirect them toward the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. Those ships will fly into the ship's <strong>superstructure,</strong> cruise along the narrow access tunnels, and destroy the <strong>main reactor</strong> with a well-placed <strong>proton torpedo.</strong> It's a desperate plan, but the heroes have pulled off incredible missions before, and <strong>Lady Aldrete</strong> begs them to take command of the <strong>starfighter squadron.</strong> It is the only hope the fleet has for surviving the battle. Skip to \"<strong>Blue Squadron</strong>,\" below.</p>\n<p>If the heroes did not stop the tractor beams from powering down, the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> is not ripped open as it tears free of the <strong>Golan platform</strong>. Instead, when the heroes arrive at the scene of the battle, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>A familiar voice crackles over your communications system. \"Well, it would come to this, wouldn't it? Trapped by the Empire, with all of these loyal men and women crushed by its might.\" The voice of Lady Aldrete sounds ragged and weary, and there is a hint of fear behind it.</em></p>\n<p><em>\"What we do now, we do for the good of the galaxy. Good luck, my friends. See to it that everyone knows that the Empire can be brought low—we merely failed today.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>In your front viewport, you see the thrusters of Lady Aldrete's command ship fire, and the vessel quickly picks up speed. It makes a straight shot for the Super Star Destroyer, shuddering as turbolaser fire splashes against its weakening shields. At the moment of impact, when Lady Aldrete's ship slams into the side of the Sarlacc Project, there is a bright flash of light and a short burst of static over the comm. In seconds, the light from the explosion fades, and her ship is no more. Where the command ship collided with the larger vessel, a huge hole now exposes the interior of the Super Star Destroyer.</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The hole opened in the <strong>Super Star Destroyer's</strong> hull allows the heroes to fly inside, just as in <strong>Lady Aldrete's</strong> plan described above. In this case, it is <strong>Captain Verana</strong> who proposes the plan to the heroes.</p>\n<h2>Blue Squadron</h2>\n<p>The remaining starfighters—<strong>11 ships in all</strong>—rally to the heroes' position and affirm that they are prepared to fly into the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> and take out the ship. Among the pilots are <strong>Captains Verana</strong> and <strong>Okeefe,</strong> both of whom have survived the battle thus far. <strong>Blue Squadron</strong>, as they have been dubbed, is at the heroes' disposal.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of the final <strong>three encounters</strong> of the adventure, <strong>Blue Squadron</strong> is considered to be engaging in their own encounters when flying into the superstructure. Basically, the <strong>starfighters</strong> are flying alongside the heroes and keeping the path clear. However, if it looks like any of the heroes is in real danger of dying (at least before the final <strong>encounter),</strong> you can have a member of<strong> Blue Squadron </strong>help. Their entrance can be dramatic, such as chasing a <strong>TIE fighter</strong> that is disintegrating in flames, or it can be a surprise, such as when <strong>Han</strong> saves <strong>Luke</strong> above the first Death <strong>Star</strong> in <em><strong>A New Hope</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>If any of the heroes have developed a strong attachment to either <strong>Captain Verana</strong> or <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong>, this might be a good time to introduce dramatic tension by putting their lives in danger. While the death of either <strong>captain</strong> might be suitably dramatic and motivate the heroes to complete their mission, neither one has to die. At this point in the campaign, you'll know whether their deaths would serve the story or harm it, but one way or another, the heroes should have to face the reality that some of their most stalwart allies are in real danger.</p>\n<h3>Flying Through the Superstructure</h3>\n<p>When the heroes have rallied <strong>Blue Squadron</strong> around them, they must enter the ship's <strong>superstructure</strong> and destroy the <strong>main reactor</strong> inside. The three <strong>encounters</strong> below must be completed in the order presented. Because the heroes will be racing toward the center of the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> as fast as possible, these three <strong>encounters</strong> could be considered to be one large <strong>encounter,</strong> but they are offered here separately to make the sequence easier to run.</p>\n<h3>Into the Ship</h3>\n<p>First, the heroes must get inside the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>. Unfortunately, a small group of TIE fighters is approaching to assist. Before the heroes can try to fly inside the ship, they must deal with the TIE fighters. Only then can they enter the superstructure at its weak point.</p>\n<p>For more information on this encounter, see the \"<strong>Into the Sarlacc's</strong> Maw\" tactical encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[jbLuoYoXJ1enryzc]{10-05 Into the Sarlacc's Maw}</strong></p>\n<p>The Fastest Path</p>\n<p>Once inside the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>, reaching the <strong>main reactor</strong> is no easy task. The tunnels within the <strong>superstructure</strong> (a necessity of design, making it possible to work on the vessel) do not simply connect <strong>point A</strong> to <strong>point B</strong> in a series of straight lines. Instead, the tunnels twist, turn, and curve. When beginning this encounter, reveal the paths available to the heroes only as they take them. This will reinforce the blindness they should experience while flying into the ship without knowing exactly where to go.</p>\n<p>For more information on this encounter, see the \"<strong>Sarlacc Superstructure</strong>\" tactical encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[phhClZfb6MidhjmV]{10-06 Sarlacc Superstructure}</strong></p>\n<h3>Main Reactor</h3>\n<p>The <strong>main reactor</strong> chamber is a large, cavernous area where the vacuum of space is used to diffuse the heat generated by the <strong>reactor.</strong> A <strong>deflector shield</strong> protects the <strong>reactor</strong> from the outside, so the heroes will have to use <strong>tertiary</strong> or <strong>secondary</strong> weapons to destroy the <strong>reactor.</strong> If the heroes do not have access to these, there is one alternative: <strong>sacrifice.</strong> A collision between a ship and the <strong>reactor,</strong> even a ship as small as a <strong>starfighter,</strong> is enough to destroy the <strong>reactor core</strong> and, by extension, the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>.</p>\n<p>For more information on this encounter, see the \"<strong>Main Reactor</strong>\" tactical encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>@JournalEntry[0wPi1bzJgGDkR1si]{10-07 Main Reactor}</strong></p>\n<h1>Concluding the Campaign</h1>\n<p>After 10 full adventures, the<strong> Dawn of Defiance</strong> campaign finally draws to a close. What began with the heroes rescuing a supposed Imperial traitor on <strong>Felucia</strong> culminates in the destruction of the first prototype <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong>, the deaths of a powerful Imperial <strong>Inquisitor</strong> and the traitorous <strong>Admiral Varth</strong>, and the Empire suffering its first great defeat at the hands of a resistance. If you've made it this far, congratulations! We hope that you and your players have enjoyed the experience. Below, you will find suggestions for wrapping up the campaign and, perhaps, the seeds of future campaigns.</p>\n<h2>Long-Term Repercussions</h2>\n<p>At first, the heroes might feel as if their efforts have done little good in the grand scheme of things. After all, the Empire will simply rebuild the <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> years later, in the form of the <em><strong>Executor</strong></em> and similar vessels. However, the heroes' actions result in two major positive outcomes. First, other minor rebellions of the galaxy realize that it is possible to resist the Empire with success. In essence, the heroes have bloodied the nose of the Empire for the first time, and other fledgling rebellions (which will eventually grow into the Rebel Alliance) now see that their causes are neither futile nor doomed to failure. Second, after the <strong>Sarlacc Project</strong> is destroyed, the Empire holds off on rebuilding the massive ship until its control over the galaxy is more firmly established. This gives its foes many years to build up small space fleets that are able to flee from <strong>Star Destroyers</strong> and other, smaller ships. Thus, the heroes' victory provides much-needed breathing room for other rebellions to build up their space forces, which directly affects the existence of the Rebel Alliance's eventual Navy.</p>\n<p>Any heroes who died during the <strong>Dawn of Defiance </strong>campaign are remembered as martyrs for the cause of resisting the Empire, regardless of whether that was their intent. Likewise, any major Gamemaster characters who sacrificed themselves are memorialized by future rebellions.</p>\n<p>Heroes who survive the campaign have achieved their destinies and lived to tell about it, a feat few people in the galaxy have managed. At this point, it's likely that your players have some idea of how they want their characters to continue. Take their wishes into account, and work with the players to determine the next step. Jedi heroes might be troublesome for campaigns looking to fit in perfectly with the Rebellion era, so it's probably a good idea for such heroes to effectively leave the civilized galaxy. For example, perhaps those heroes, now Jedi Masters, head into the Unknown Regions in search of allies to help them bring down the Empire, or they might vanish within the <strong>Deep Core</strong> while on an undercover mission to subvert the Emperor's schemes. Other heroes might show up again in future campaigns as Gamemaster characters, giving you a great way to let them become part of the larger universe.</p>\n<p>As for <strong>Bail Organa</strong>, after his involvement in the heroes' rise, he becomes an icon around which many rebellious elements rally. However, the Empire does not forget his role in these events, and his involvement is just one more mark against him that results in the eventual destruction of <strong>Alderaan.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>What if They Fail?</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the adventure's assumptions that the heroes succeed in their tasks, the Empire might yet win the day. If the heroes fail to destroy the <strong>Sarlacc Project,</strong> they likely all die, bringing the campaign to an end. However, their failure can serve as the genesis of a future campaign, in which the Empire has a prototype <strong>Super Star Destroyer</strong> that it uses to terrorize the galaxy in secret. <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> isn't ready to reveal the ship's existence publicly—at least, not until the Emperor demands it—and in the meantime, a new generation of heroes hears rumors of a massive ship that leaves only debris in its wake. The new campaign can consist of chasing the <strong>Super Star Destroyer's</strong> trail across the galaxy and culminate when the heroes lay a trap for the vessel, luring <strong>Admiral Varth</strong> and his prize into a position from which the ship can be destroyed.   </p>\n</blockquote>","folder":"NyGBcdoM5aaCnKgh","sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xb1UhfnGNsCjnKCR":3},"flags":{}}

The car is coupled at <strong>six</strong> separate <strong>attachment points,</strong> and the heroes can make only a single attempt on each coupler. There are several different ways to approach each one, and each attempt requires an action:</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 1:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</strong> to contort your body to squeeze underneath a twisted floor plate, tripping the emergency release on a coupler concealed within.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 2:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>to brave the high winds to reach a coupler’s emergency release on the outside of the repulsorcar.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 3:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to use your knowledge of similar devices, examine an unlabeled coupler to determine which release lever is the correct one.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 4 and 5:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong> to cut through fused joints to release the locking mechanisms using their toolkit.</p>\n<p><strong>Any Coupler: </strong>A <strong>DC 15 Strength check </strong>to brute force and apply smart leverage to pry apart twisted metal.</p>\n<p><strong>Any Coupler: </strong>Using the force to pry apart the broken twisted, broken metal and to decouple the coupler.</p>\n<p><strong>Couplers #4, #5,</strong> and <strong>#6 </strong>can be separated from the intercar area, but couplers <strong>#1</strong>, <strong>#2</strong>, and <strong>#3</strong> can be released only from inside the <strong>lounge car </strong>(exposing the heroes to fire from the elite mercenary team).</p>\n<p>If the heroes make no attempt at all for <strong>1 round</strong>, the repulsorcar groans under the stress as more support members buckle and break; one <strong>coupler,</strong> <strong>determined randomly</strong>, automatically <strong>fails.</strong></p>\n<p>Once a total of four are safely uncoupled, the trailing repulsorcars separate without incident and the passengers are safe. If <strong>all six</strong> are attempted without achieving <strong>four successes,</strong> the uncoupling releases a massive ionic discharge. Every character within <strong>20 feet</strong> of the rear of the repulsor car must make a <strong>DC 15 Dexterity saving throw</strong>. On a failed save, the target takes <strong>11 ([[/r 2d10[ion] # Ion damage]]) damage</strong> for every coupler that was not released correctly, up to maximum of <strong>66 (12d10) ion damage</strong>.

The man appears to be the same one detailed in the hologram that Admiral Varth sent with his transmission, but his real name isn’t Pavel Trenol; it’s <strong>Tavik Moern. </strong><strong>The Human looks to be the same one depicted in the</strong></p>\n<p><strong>hologram that</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Admiral Varth sent you. His brown hair</strong></p>\n<p><strong>is medium length, and his</strong></p>\n<p><strong>brown eyes regard you with</strong></p>\n<p><strong>apprehension. He wears a set of greasestained</strong></p>\n<p><strong>coveralls, a tool belt, and a pair of scuffed workman’s</strong></p>\n<p><strong>boots.</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Not a todo, but my general thoughts. I'm assuming you'll proof your own NPCs. Tell me if you need me to look over one. I'm assuming you NEED me to look over your starships, so I will do that without asking. The Bashee, you diverged from the stat block, so I took you on faith there, <strong>Created the Banshee using the Baudo-class star yacht - Modified - there was a note in the shipyard that said that statblock was used for the Dawn of Defiance adventure</strong> but when we get to the TIE and the Z-95, I'll compare your ships to the google docs stat blocks and see if you missed anything (or even more likely missed a bug that we need to hand correct, like I found with the A-wing.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Last Priority, don't touch until right before we release (but I don't want to forget):</p>\n<p>There's a bug that an NPC can't serve in a deployment for a ship. I believe the problem isn't on the ship sheet but the character sheet. You'll notice that the Banshee has a proficiency bonus of +0 even though it should have Okeefe's prof bonus. If you make a scratch version of Okeefe as a PC and give her the right deployments, SHE will transfer her prof bonus to the ship, but this takes a little fudging because among other things a PC doesn't calculate prof bonus the same way an NPC does.</p>\n<p>I think this has to do with the fact that her rank is still 0, even though she HAS deployment ranks. If you give a PC deployment ranks, their overall rank actually goes up, and I think that's the number the starship sheet reads to determine if it takes the character's prof bonus.</p>\n<p>However I've reported this bug and I think it's VERY likely it will be fixed before we release, so I say we build everything assuming it will work right and make a few specific \"Deployment PC versions\" of characters at the very end, just in case we need them to make ships work.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I believe the proper foundry notation for damage is 1d6[kinetic] damage, not 1d6 kinetic damage. I don't know why, but that's how I keep seeing it from the big mods.</p>\n<p><strong>Reminder: </strong>You don't need to put in day/night versions of maps. That's a feature of foundry. I think I did it for a visual bit in one of the encounters. But it's just a lighting effect you can turn on and off. I'll stop doing it. You're right. It confuses GMs.</p>\n<p>Adv 7, Part 1. In case it's not immediately evident, there's three maps in the journal as a visual aid for the GM. The first is the safehouse. This probably doesn't need a separate scene, it's used in 7-04 already, so a GM can repurpose that scene if needed. The floophouse, however, is a backdoor scene that the adventure provides but doesn't fully outlined as one of those 4e era encounters. It just might happen if the party starts a fight with the thugs. The map guy made maps, so we should probably make a scene, just in case. Drop a 3p0 droid in the lobby and the seven thugs loitering outside. Since the bottom floor has the street, the bottom and top maps cover different-sized areas, so you can't just make them the same size. You'll need to make tiles (They should probably both be in the same scene). The description says the guy's room is 15 foot square, though, so that gives you a scale on the second floor and you should be able to figure out the first floor scale by comparing it to the second floor and then resizing to allow for the street outside. Was that clear?</p>\n<p>Give the first two handouts in adventure 6 an extra good proofread. They have a fair amount of new text, and it's never good to rely on yourself to proof your own text.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Fix the doors in the Felucian Prison Map. Missing from most rooms. Too small where they are. I don't know a good fix for that last. Resolution?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Are you sure you don't want players to be able to move onto medical tables, because that's a standard move in almost every fight and you've walled them off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">All the tokens have vision. It's considered bad practice to give NPCs vision. It's a large load on processing speed with very little gain. A GM can tell if a token can see something. He doesn't need immersion.

Since their last adventure, the heroes have spent some downtime aboard the Nebulon-B frigate <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, which is apparently owned by <strong>Bail Organa</strong>. The ship spends all of its time in deep space, between worlds and away from major hyperspace routes, and it currently serves as a mobile safe house for former Imperial <strong>Admiral Gilder Varth</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> was recently rescued from an Imperial <strong>prison facility</strong> (either by the heroes, if they played in <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em>, or by other agents of<strong> Bail Organa </strong>if they didn’t) and brought to the <em><strong>Resurgence </strong></em>to be debriefed. <strong>Captain Adrian Verana</strong> is the commanding officer of the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>, and he has overseen <strong>Varth’s</strong> safety and debriefing over the last few weeks. The whole time, <strong>Captain Verana</strong> has made it clear that no one should mention <strong>Bail Organa’s </strong>name because the Senator cannot risk being known to be involved in case the Empire happens upon the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. Even <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> does not know for certain that it was <strong>Organa </strong>who had him rescued (unless the heroes told him, of course).</p>\n<p>In the time between the end of <em><strong>The Traitor’s Gambit</strong></em> and the beginning of <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em>, you should feel free to include encounters with <strong>Captain Verana</strong>, <strong>Gilder Varth</strong>, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> (the owner and operator of the Baudo -class Star Yacht, the <em><strong>Banshee</strong></em>). The heroes should get to know these three characters a bit better because all of them will have roles of varying importance throughout the campaign. When <em><strong>A Wretched Hive</strong></em> opens, the heroes should be fully healed and have had a chance to obtain needed supplies and resources. The <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em> is a well-stocked ship and can provide the group with most mundane items.</p>\n<h2>The Briefing</h2>\n<p>The adventure begins when the heroes are summoned to the briefing room aboard the <em><strong>Resurgence</strong></em>. When they arrive, they find that <strong>Gilder Varth</strong> awaits them, now dressed in the uniform of an Alderaanian ship officer. At his side is a small yellow-and silver astromech droid that whistles softly as it interfaces with a computer system. Once the heroes arrive, read the following boxed text aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"line-height:normal;margin:6.0pt 0in 6.0pt 0in\"><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The briefing room aboard the </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Resurgence</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> is clean and white, with several benches wrapping smoothly around a holographic projector seated on a raised dais in the center of the room. The projector springs to life, and the blue-tinted hologram of a Hutt appears to hover a few inches away from the projector’s three curved prongs. With a brusque clearing of his throat, former Imperial officer </span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Gilder Varth</span><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> begins to speak, wasting little time on pleasantries.</span></em></p>\n<p><em>“Before the Empire decided my conscience was a liability,” he says, “I was involved peripherally in a top-secret plan known as the Sarlacc Project. While the details of the project are unknown to me, I was involved in the transfer of large sums of credits and resources to the project. Whatever the project entails, it is taking up a lot of the Empire’s time and effort. Moreover, I believe that this Sarlacc Project is destroying the lives of thousands of sentient beings; casualty reports crossed my desk on a regular basis.</em></p>\n<p><em>“Unfortunately, I don’t know much more than that. However, during my brief brushes with the project, I discovered that the Imperial Navy was hiding the program’s existence from the Senate by transferring resources through secondary sources. Resources were routed through the Corporate Sector, through fake contractors, and through the criminal underworld to keep a trail from leading back to the project.</em></p>\n<p><em>“One such secondary source was a Hutt crime lord named Darga. Like all Hutts, Darga is a slimy gangster whose love of credits is exceeded only by his love of power. Part of my job involved transferring resources to Darga, and in turn arranging for Imperial agents to take control of other resources from the Hutt’s organization. These were not simply transfers of credits. The items being traded were not specified, but physical resources were definitely being exchanged. Though it’s not much, this is the only lead we have. “Captain Verana has charged me with helping to uncover more about the Sarlacc Project, and he has authorized me to use you as my agents. We need you to travel to the planet of Cato Neimoidia and find Darga the Hutt. See if you can learn what he is trading in and how it relates to the Sarlacc Project.”</em></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Varth</strong> keeps the briefing short and sweet. He has an air about him that immediately recalls his military past; though he is not unfriendly, he spares no time for idle chatter. It should be clear to the heroes that <strong>Varth</strong> has not adjusted to life outside of the Imperial Navy; he still acts with the same rigidity that is characteristic of all Imperial officers. He seems uncomfortable in his Alderaanian uniform, but his professionalism won’t allow him to voice any complaints. The man is all business, and though he seems genuine in his assertions, he remains largely unreadable. After the briefing, the heroes might have some questions about their mission. The following section provides answers to common questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why should we do this for you?</strong> “<em>In exchange for your assistance, Captain Verana has authorized me to pay each of you a modest sum. Additionally, this may be a chance to discover what the Empire is planning with the Sarlacc Project—which could have big repercussions if I am right.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What else do you know about the Sarlacc Project? </strong>“<em>Not much more than I’ve told you. My only involvement came in managing resources, and most of those transactions were encoded.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to find Darga the Hutt? </strong>“<em>Unfortunately, Darga’s exact whereabouts are unknown. However, he has been seen in the Cato Neimoidian city of Zarra. Chances are that someone in the city knows where he is.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How do we discover the extent of Darga’s involvement in the Sarlacc Project?</strong> “<em>Darga is not one to give up his secrets easily, but he has been known to take associates into his trust. If you can get inside his palace, he might reveal what is going on—or you might be able to find out by snooping around.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What can you tell us about Zarra?</strong> “<em>Zarra was heavily damaged during the Clone Wars, and half of the city is still in ruins. The few residents that have chosen to remain inhabit a cluster of settlements on one end of the city.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How are we supposed to get to Cato Neimoidia?</strong> “<em>Captain Verana has chartered passage for you aboard the Banshee, the transport vessel captained by Sirona Okeefe. After helping you rescue me from my prison on Felucia, Captain Okeefe quickly found herself on retainer.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/images/resurgence_nebulon-b_escort_frigate_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[SyI9doYoK0fiAtkf]{09 - Handout 9 - Resurgence}</p>\n<h2>Arrival</h2>\n<p>The trip to <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> is uneventful, and when the heroes arrive, they find a planet that is far from its former glory in the days before the Clone Wars. A world in the <strong>Colonies</strong>, <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> should be far more populated than it is. When the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>drops out of hyperspace, any heroes in the cockpit can see that there is very little traffic traveling to and from the world. As the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>descends toward the planet, the ship flies through layers of clouds and zooms over cities that are built on massive bridges between rock arches. However, the bridge cities are all but abandoned, seemingly left to rot after the Clone Wars.</p>\n<p>The heroes land on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> with no difficulty and no visible Imperial presence. The <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>docks at a spaceport in the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and though propaganda posters line the spaceport walls, there is no sign of <strong>stormtroopers</strong> or other Imperial officials. Regardless, <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> cautions the heroes against acting foolishly. The Empire still controls the planet, and though its current presence is not strong, the situation could change quickly.</p>\n<p><strong>Zarra</strong> itself is dilapidated to the point of being hazardous. As the heroes walk the streets, they see little in the way of authority or commerce. Several large buildings that appear to have been lavish palaces of Neimoidian merchants lie half toppled and mostly destroyed. Rubble litters the streets, and landspeeders must veer sharply to avoid chunks of permacrete lying haphazardly in the road. Though a number of beings, mostly shabby-looking Neimoidians, roam the streets, it is clear that <strong>Zarra </strong>has been nearly abandoned since the Clone Wars.</p>\n<h2>Sample Citizens</h2>\n<p>During this part of the adventure, the heroes might come into contact with members of the local populace. Below are several <strong>Cato Neimoidian</strong> citizens to use as quick reference when the heroes begin moving about the city of <strong>Zarra</strong>. Each uses the typical statistics block below. Feel free to invent your own NPCs or introduce other characters here as well.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Krett, Cantina Owner:</strong> Male Neimoidian, owns the <strong>Federation’s Folly</strong>, a cantina in <strong>Zarra</strong>. A veteran of the Clone Wars, Krett once commanded a Lucrehulk-class battleship but was exiled to <strong>Cato Neimoidia </strong>and is still bitter.</li>\n<li><strong>Nillia, Spaceport Administrator:</strong> Female Neimoidian, keeps tabs on all the ships coming and going from <strong>Zarra</strong>. She is bored with her job and longs to leave, and she seems wistful, as if seeking something more.</li>\n<li><strong>Vigro, Speeder Repairman:</strong> Male Neimoidian, operates <strong>Vigro’s Repulsorlifts</strong>, a landspeeder repair shop. He is suspicious of outsiders and believes that even honest customers are out to swindle him.</li>\n<li><strong>Salitt, Beggar:</strong> Male Neimoidian who begs on the streets of <strong>Zarra</strong>. He claims that he was once the Viceroy of the Trade Federation (he wasn’t) and seems distinctly deluded and paranoid.</li>\n<li><strong>Shass, Trader: </strong>Female Neimoidian, owner of <strong>Zarran Imports and Exports</strong>. A shrewd businesswoman, she had aspirations of rising through the ranks of the Trade Federation until the blockade of Naboo, when she refused to go any further in a corrupt organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Desson, Laborer:</strong> Male Neimoidian who works to rebuild <strong>Zarra</strong>. Desson seems like a man whose aspirations have been trod on for too long, such that now he is merely going through the motions.</li>\n<li><strong>Borlo, Imperial Informant:</strong> Male Neimoidian who earns his keep by feeding information to the Empire about any unusual happenings. He seems friendly and outgoing, but his eyes glisten with the promise of Imperial credits.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>@Actor[KTzw2sOaWqPYAj0K]{Cato Neimoidian Citizen}</strong></p>\n<h2>A Visit from the Vipers</h2>\n<p>As the heroes arrive on<strong> Cato Neimoidia</strong>, they are hassled by a local swoop gang. The <strong>Vipers,</strong> a rough gang of thugs who terrorize <strong>Zarra</strong> on a daily basis, always look for fresh prey when an outlander starship arrives. The swoop gang’s leader is a violent Human woman named <strong>Kessra.</strong> She is the only female member of the gang, but she bears the scars of several past battles. From the <strong>Vipers’</strong> demeanor, it is clear that they follow her unquestioningly. However, they don’t realize that <strong>Kessra</strong> sometimes takes small jobs from <strong>Darga the Hutt</strong>. She uses her gang to achieve the crime lord’s goals in <strong>Zarra</strong>.</p>\n<p>As the heroes depart the spaceport where the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>is docked, the <strong>Vipers</strong> ride in quickly and surround the party. <strong>Kessra</strong> taunts the heroes from the back of her swoop bike, claiming that they’ve failed to pay for a landing permit from the <strong>Vipers.</strong> If they wish to pass unharmed, they’ll have to dole out <strong>1,000 credits</strong> each. The heroes can pay the outlandish extortion fee, and if they do, <strong>Kessra</strong> pegs them as easy targets and leads the <strong>Vipers</strong> away—for now. But the whole time that the heroes stay in <strong>Zarra</strong>, gang members continue to shake them down for more money. They might even try <strong>attacking </strong>the <em><strong>Banshee </strong></em>if the heroes don’t eventually put up a fight, and <strong>Captain Okeefe</strong> is not pleased about having to drive off a gang of bikers.</p>\n<p>If the heroes refuse to pay the exorbitant amount that the <strong>Vipers</strong> demand, the swoop gang launches an <strong>attack</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Swoop Marauders</h2>\n<p>For details on the encounter, see: <strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[lf6mpWl6C4UXlNma]{2-01 Swoop Marauders}</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"worlds/dawnofdefiance/characters/named_npcs/kessra/kessra_art.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"750\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">@JournalEntry[T9pbtvnEabrgEbUE]{03 - Handout 3 - Kessra}</span></p>\n<h2>Locating Darga's Palace</h2>\n<p>With nothing more to go on than a city and the name of a Hutt, the heroes don’t have many leads to follow. Asking questions about a Hutt crime lord can be a dangerous business in <strong>Zarra</strong>, and most citizens rebuff the heroes if they try. However, after a few attempts to find <strong>Darga</strong>, the heroes should come to realize that the Hutt lives in the city and is, in fact, well known, even if no one will reveal his exact location. But there is one way for the heroes to learn where <strong>Darga </strong>resides. One of his flunkies, a young Devaronian thief and errand boy named<strong> Warrick “Womp Rat” Raden</strong>, spends a great deal of time in the city. If the heroes can locate <strong>Raden</strong>, he can lead them directly to the Hutt’s secret <strong>palace</strong>. Below are some suggestions on how to handle the search for <strong>Raden</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gather Information:</strong> Heroes who are trained in the <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) skill</strong> have an advantage in trying to find the Hutt. Though they cannot locate <strong><em>Darga</em> </strong>with the skill, they can find <strong>Raden</strong>, who takes pains to keep his movements low key (if not secret). A hero can use <strong>Intelligence (Investigation)</strong> to find him; the <strong>DC</strong> is <strong>25</strong> and the information costs <strong>500 credits</strong> in bribes. Success indicates that the heroes are told where to find <strong>Raden</strong>—a nearby ruined warehouse.</p>\n<p><strong>False Pretenses:</strong> The heroes might try to gain the attention of the Hutt and his associates through deception. This might include pretending to be a rival gang eager to start trouble or posing as fellow criminals looking to work with (or for) the Hutt. However, most citizens of <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong> want nothing to do with the underworld, so if the heroes identify themselves as criminals of any kind, the residents shun them or refuse to do business with them.</p>\n<p>If the heroes spread rumors in an attempt to draw the Hutt’s interest, it takes <strong>two days</strong> before they see results. Provided that they didn’t spread rumors likely to provoke the crime lord (such as “<em><strong>We’re here to kill that slimy Hutt and take over this planet for our own!</strong></em>”), they receive an anonymous message telling them to meet <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> at the ruined warehouse at midnight. The message actually comes from one of <strong>Darga’s </strong>informants in <strong>Zarra</strong>, not from <strong>Raden</strong> himself, so the errand boy knows nothing of the heroes’ impending arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Bribery:</strong> No matter how much the citizens fear dealing with the criminal underworld, the right amount of credits can always open doors If the heroes visit traders, cantinas, spaceports, and even security offices searching for information on <strong>Darga</strong>, the right bribes can get them the information they need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>100 credits</strong> or less reveals no information regarding <strong>Darga</strong>, only that “<em><strong>some Hutt</strong></em>” has been terrorizing the people of <strong>Zarra</strong>.</li>\n<li>A bribe of <strong>101</strong> to <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes the name of the Hutt’s associate, <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, and lowers the <strong>DC</strong> on an<strong> Intelligence (Investigation) check</strong> by <strong>10</strong> to locate the errand boy.</li>\n<li>A bribe of more than <strong>500 credits</strong> earns the heroes not only <strong>Warrick Raden’s</strong> name but also the location of the abandoned warehouse where he can be found.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Threats and Violence: </strong>Though more in line with the Empire’s tactics, the heroes can use threats and violence to get information about <strong>Darga</strong>. Most of the population of <strong>Zarra </strong>is already cowed by the Hutt’s thugs and associates. Combined with occasional Imperial intervention, which never goes well even for law-abiding citizens, the locals have very little fight left in them.</p>\n<p>Using the <strong>Charisma (Intimidation) skill</strong> to intimidate citizens of <strong>Zarra </strong>only goes so far. A successfully intimidated citizen can say only that a Devaronian named <strong>Warrick Raden</strong> works for <strong>Darga </strong>and sometimes comes around to collect extortion money or deliver messages on the Hutt’s behalf. This information grants the same <strong>-10 DC bonus </strong>on <strong>Intelligence (Investigation) checks</strong> that bribery does.</p>\n<p>If the heroes use violence to find <strong>Darga</strong>, such as abusing local business owners or picking a fight in a cantina, they eventually get a message from one of the Hutt’s hidden agents who believes that the heroes are auditioning to join the organization. This message is identical to the one described under “<strong>False Pretenses</strong>,” above.</p>\n<p>However, violence does not sit well with the citizens of <strong>Zarra</strong>, and eventually one becomes scared enough to alert Imperial authorities to the heroes’ activities. An Imperial patrol consisting of <strong>six stormtroopers</strong> and an <strong>Imperial Junior Officer</strong> arrives on a transport skiff and attempts to take the heroes into custody. The Imperials call for reinforcements if the heroes resist arrest, and soon <strong>Zarra </strong>might be crawling with a large percentage of the Imperial forces on <strong>Cato Neimoidia</strong>, attracting attention the heroes do not want.</p>\n<p><strong>6 @Actor[aZyRzHqGfGujPvX0]{Stormtroopers}</strong></p>\n<p><strong>@Actor[56Fie9duL2tF66az]{Imperial Junior Officer}</strong></p>\n<h2>Finding Raden</h2>\n<p>When the heroes finally locate <strong>Warrick Raden</strong>, they quickly discover that he does not want to be found or to talk about <strong>Darga</strong>.

If failed by <strong>less than 5</strong>, the character keeps their <strong>stake,</strong> if failed by <strong>less than 10</strong>, the character gives up <strong>half</strong> their <strong>stake,</strong> if failed by<strong> 10 or more</strong>, they give their entire <strong>stake</strong> to the competing character.</p>\n<p>A player with less than <strong>2,000 credits</strong> can still play however they make the <strong>check</strong> with <strong>disadvantage</strong> as it is easier for other characters to push them out of the game with high bets and on a failed <strong>check</strong> they automatically give their entire <strong>stake</strong> to the competing character.</p>\n<p>A player may come up with ways to affect their chances at winning. If they attempt to bluff, read body language or something else that would distract their opponents or give them an edge, consider giving them <strong>advantage</strong> for their next roll. However if they attempt to cheat, a failed <strong>check</strong> results in their expulsion from the game and the group attitude of the <strong>Gala</strong> attendants drops by one level (for example, from <strong>indifferent</strong> to <strong>unfriendly).</strong></p>\n<p>The players at the table are listed below with their <strong>bankroll.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ardia Terrsyn</strong>, actress (<strong>major guest</strong>) — <strong>5,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dien Subb</strong>, SoroSuub executive (<strong>major guest</strong>) — <strong>6,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Zalar Rishek</strong>, scion of the House of Rishek (<strong>major guest</strong>) — <strong>4,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tavid Ahkoeri</strong> — <strong>2,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Anjeru Valett</strong> — <strong>2,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dyni Endarsin</strong> — <strong>2,000 credits</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> If the heroes defeat all the minor guests <strong>(Tavid Ahkoeri, Anjeru</strong> <strong>Valett</strong>, and <strong>Dyni Endarsin),</strong> they impress the other attendees, improving the <strong>group attitude</strong> of the guests by <strong>one step</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat a <strong>major guest,</strong> they can either improve the attitude of that <strong>major guest</strong> by <strong>one step</strong> or improve the <strong>group attitude</strong> of the <strong>Gala</strong> attendants by <strong>one step.</strong></p>\n<p>Regardless of how well the heroes perform during this <strong>encounter,</strong> the <strong>group attitude</strong> of the <strong>Gala</strong> attendants cannot have a net improvement of more than <strong>one step.</strong> For example, if the heroes were caught cheating (one step worse) but they beat <strong>three major guests</strong> (each worth <strong>one step</strong> of improvement), the net effect is <strong>one step</strong> of improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Any <strong>credits</strong> won during these games are allowed to be kept.

If successful, you avoid drawing attention to your breathtaking lack of knowledge about academia, skillfully redirecting questions toward another in the conversation.</p>\n<p>The objective is for the heroes to contribute something meaningful to the conversation as many times as possible out of <strong>8 rounds</strong> of conversation. If the heroes make three or more embarrassing, uneducated, or amateurish remarks (signified by a failed <strong>ability check</strong>) in total, they prompt chuckles and condescending remarks from the other guests (“Well, I suppose someone has to attend those universities on the Outer Rim”), effectively ending this challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge: </strong>Only one hero can play against <strong>Governor Nabin</strong> in a game of holochess. The objective is to be successful at least <strong>four times</strong> with various strategies, outlined below, resulting in the hero checkmating the governor. However, if the hero hasn’t done so after <strong>six attempts,</strong> the governor’s superior experience in the game allows him to defeat the hero by attrition after a protracted struggle.</p>\n<p>Have the players make <strong>DC 25 Intelligence (dejarik set) check</strong>, If the player is also involved in conversation, resolve that after each <strong>round</strong> of holochess. If you wish to explain some of the moves in greater detail, use the sample explanations below for inspiration for either failure or success.</p>\n<p><strong>Lightning Round. </strong>The player plans out several contingencies while examining Nabin's moves, as he finishes his contemplation and move, the player swiftly responds, intimidating the governor somewhat.</p>\n<p><strong>Relentless Assault.</strong> The player executes a flawless classical set-piece attack, keeping the governor on the retreat and backfoot.</p>\n<p><strong>Misdirect and Reveal.</strong> The player draws the governor's attention to an intricate feint, but their moves open up a completely unexpected avenue of attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Spoiler.</strong> Instead of the player siezing the offensive, they anticipate the governor's next move, playing solely to spoil his attacks and frustrate him into making a mistake that leaves him vulnerable elsewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> Successful participation in the conversation improves either <strong>group attitude, Dien Suub’s</strong> attitude, or <strong>Cednah Faenel’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.</strong> If the heroes do so without a single failure, <strong>all three</strong> improve by one step.</p>\n<p>Defeating <strong>Governor Nabin</strong> improves either <strong>guest attitude</strong> or the <strong>governor’s attitude</strong> by one step.

When the heroes dine, some other guests at the <strong>main table</strong> include <strong>Morrax Nabin,</strong> Imperial governor <strong>(major guest); Lynaa,</strong> famed fashion designer <strong>(major guest); Cednah Faenel,</strong> Alderaanian noblewoman <strong>(major guest);</strong> Capt. <strong>Z’paul Diin,</strong> Dr. <strong>Hakaen Bousch,</strong> and <strong>Ruf-Asti-Viarffli.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The challenge for the heroes is to make civilized conversation while enjoying the finest foods from across the galaxy—and without looking like they just fell off a spice freighter from Tatooine. To make a good impression, the heroes need to participate meaningfully in the conversation as many times as possible, up to a maximum of <strong>six.</strong></p>\n<p>Three unsuccessful attempts to participate—whether unsophisticated (“<em><strong>Yummy!</strong></em>”) or uninformed (“<em><strong>Of course nerf come from Bespin!</strong></em>”)—result in the heroes’ opinions not being taken seriously for the remainder of the meal, effectively ending the challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Light Conversation:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. On a success, they engage their dining partners in casual conversation unrelated to the meal but charming nonetheless. Empty banter grows tiresome, however, so add <strong>+3</strong> to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt by any of the heroes.</p>\n<p><strong>Oenology:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong>, allowing players to add their <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> if they are proficient in <strong>brewer's kits.</strong> On a success, they make insightful observations about the wine, remarking on its vintage and character. A failure makes this option unavailable to them for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret Ingredients:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong>, allowing players to add their <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> if they are proficient in <strong>chef's kits</strong> or <strong>DC 22 Wisdom (Survival) check</strong> On a success, their experience with foods—improvised or otherwise—on countless worlds allows them to identify and comment on some of the herbs, spices, and other ingredients in a given dish.</p>\n<p><strong>Exotic Dishes:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 15 Intelligence check</strong>, allowing players to add their <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> if they are proficient in <strong>chef's kits.</strong> On a success, they recall something about the planet and culture of origin for a particular dish, perhaps commenting on the chef’s reinterpretation of the traditional version.</p>\n<p><strong>No, Seriously, I’m a Chef:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 17 Charisma (Deception) check</strong>. On a success, they make up some detail about a dish that sounds plausible, at least for the duration of the meal. Repeated fabrications eventually push the boundaries of believability, so add <strong>+2</strong> to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt by any of the heroes. On a failure, the other guests become incredulous at their “<strong>facts</strong>,” making this option unavailable to any hero for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>FoodNet Addict:</strong> Make a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong>. On a success, all that time spent browsing the HoloNet pays off, and they recall reading or watching something about a given dish. A failure makes this option unavailable to them for the rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Taking a Peek: </strong>If a player is <strong>force</strong> sensitive, have them make a <strong>DC 20 universal force-casting check.</strong> On a success, they glimpse some detail about a dish’s origin, perhaps a brief vision about how it was prepared. On a failure, they cannot do this rest of the encounter.</p>\n<p><strong>Development:</strong> If the heroes make fewer than three blunders during their conversation over dinner, improve the group attitude of the guests and the individual attitude of all <strong>major guests</strong> by <strong>one</strong> <strong>step</strong>. If the heroes failed to do so but still had at least <strong>one success</strong> for each hero before accumulating three failures, the heroes can improve either group <strong>attitude</strong> or the <strong>attitude</strong> of a single <strong>major guest</strong> by <strong>one step.</strong></p>\n<h4>Encounter Map</h4>\n<p>This is a social encounter.

Cloaked in darkness and illuminated only by multicolored strobe lights, holoprojectors, and table lamps, the entire car pulses with a pounding beat. The younger guests (and the young at heart) come here to dance, carouse, and flirt—not necessarily in that order. Some notable guests present when the heroes arrive include <strong>Ardia Terrsyn,</strong> actress <strong>(major guest); Lynaa,</strong> famed fashion designer <strong>(major guest); Zalar Rishek,</strong> scion of the House of Rishek <strong>(major guest); Khyyynett, Brial Sullor,</strong> and <strong>Fia Nazhena.</strong></p>\n<p>The bouncer at the door refuses entry to the heroes (“<em><strong>You’re not on the list</strong></em>”) unless the guests have a group attitude of <strong>friendly</strong> or better, or at least one <strong>major guest</strong> has an <strong>attitude</strong> of <strong>friendly</strong> or better. However, the bouncer can be bribed (<strong>200 credits</strong>) with a <strong>DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. Offering <strong>ten times</strong> this amount grants <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Primary Challenge:</strong> The heroes need to make a memorable impression on these guests, being eye-catching, entertaining, and captivating even as they try not to look like they’re trying too hard. The heroes want to accumulate as many <strong>successes</strong> as possible, to a <strong>maximum</strong> of <strong>six.</strong> A little humiliation goes a long way, though: If the heroes accumulate a total of <strong>three failed activities</strong> over the <strong>encounter,</strong> their efforts begin to draw ridicule and scorn, effectively ending the challenge. (Heroes who want to participate in the auxiliary challenge, below, cannot participate in the <strong>primary challenge.)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Served!</strong> Make a <strong>DC 16 Charisma (Performance) check</strong>. If successful, your dance moves impress the crowd, outshining the competition. On a failure, you are outperformed by a rival, effectively closing off this approach. Because you need to show off new moves, add <strong>+2 </strong>to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt.

If successful, you attract the attention of a romantic prospect, making you the center of attention. On a failure, you are shot down in a particularly visible way, preventing further attempts. It’s difficult to attract multiple prospects in rapid succession, so add <strong>+2</strong> to the <strong>DC</strong> for each previous attempt.</p>\n<p><strong>Club Mix: </strong>You hit the audio booth and take a turn at mixing some tunes. Make a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> or <strong>DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. If successful, you mix a creative mash-up of different songs, drawing rousing approval from the crowd. On a failure, your attempt is halting, uneven, and embarrassing, preventing any future attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Break It Up! </strong>A scuffle breaks out near you between <strong>Zalar Rishek (major guest)</strong> and <strong>Khyyynett,</strong> with their respective entourages looking on. Make a <strong>DC 22 Charisma (Persuasion) check</strong>. If successful, you convince the two calm down before the situation escalates. If you fail, the scuffle escalates into a brawl before the players eyes. Heroes can use the <strong>Help action</strong> to grant <strong>advantage</strong> on this <strong>check</strong> if they are also proficient in <strong>Persuasion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Auxiliary Challenge:</strong> Though <strong>lumguzzling</strong> is mostly associated with Corellian spacers’ dives, the drinking contest has gained popularity (and notoriety) on the club scene and among idle rich who are “<strong>slumming.</strong>” In this challenge, one or more heroes go head to head with a rowdy bunch of drinkers, among them <strong>Lynaa</strong> (who, despite being twice the age of most in attendance, is quite gifted at the game). Whoever remains standing is the winner.</p>\n<p>Have the players make a <strong>DC 15 Constitution saving throw</strong> when they first take a drink, on a successful <strong>save</strong> the player suffers no ill effects and continue to the next <strong>round.</strong> On a failed save the player is still standing but becomes intoxicated, gaining the <strong>@Compendium[sw5e.conditions.fGgXKHClM9aTq8t7]{Poisoned}</strong> condition. If they fail the <strong>save</strong> by <strong>5 or more</strong>, they fall <strong>unconscious</strong> and fail the challenge. The <strong>DC </strong>of the <strong>Consitution</strong> save increases by <strong>1</strong> after every <strong>round.</strong></p>\n<p>If multiple heroes <strong>participate</strong> and last <strong>4 rounds</strong>, all receive <strong>full credit</strong> for beating the opposition, but the players can continue the contest for additional <strong>rounds</strong> for the sake of bragging rights.</p>\n<p>Though <em>lum</em> is a strong alcoholic beverage, its chemical structure breaks down exponentially faster as its concentration increases in an individual’s bloodstream, making it impossible to overdose on the drink. Because of this, any ill effects caused by <strong>lumguzzling</strong> is automatically removed if the hero rests for <strong>10 minutes</strong> after the end of the <strong>encounter.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Development: </strong>If the heroes complete the primary challenge, they improve either <strong>group attitude</strong> or <strong>Ardia Terrsyn’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.</strong> If they broke up a fight, they also improve <strong>Zalar Rishek’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.</strong> If at least one hero completes the <strong>auxiliary challenge,</strong> he or she improves either <strong>group attitude</strong> or <strong>Lynaa’s</strong> attitude by <strong>one step.

The car is coupled at <strong>six</strong> separate <strong>attachment points,</strong> and the heroes can make only a single attempt on each coupler. There are several different ways to approach each one, and each attempt requires an action:</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 1:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check</strong> to contort your body to squeeze underneath a twisted floor plate, tripping the emergency release on a coupler concealed within.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 2:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check </strong>to brave the high winds to reach a coupler’s emergency release on the outside of the repulsorcar.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 3:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check</strong> to use your knowledge of similar devices, examine an unlabeled coupler to determine which release lever is the correct one.</p>\n<p><strong>Coupler 4 and 5:</strong> A <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong> to cut through fused joints to release the locking mechanisms using their toolkit.</p>\n<p><strong>Any Coupler: </strong>A <strong>DC 15 Strength check </strong>to brute force and apply smart leverage to pry apart twisted metal.</p>\n<p><strong>Any Coupler: </strong>Using the force to pry apart the broken twisted, broken metal and to decouple the coupler.</p>\n<p><strong>Couplers #4, #5,</strong> and <strong>#6 </strong>can be separated from the intercar area, but couplers <strong>#1</strong>, <strong>#2</strong>, and <strong>#3</strong> can be released only from inside the <strong>lounge car </strong>(exposing the heroes to fire from the elite mercenary team).</p>\n<p>If the heroes make no attempt at all for <strong>1 round</strong>, the repulsorcar groans under the stress as more support members buckle and break; one <strong>coupler,</strong> <strong>determined randomly</strong>, automatically <strong>fails.</strong></p>\n<p>Once a total of four are safely uncoupled, the trailing repulsorcars separate without incident and the passengers are safe. If <strong>all six</strong> are attempted without achieving <strong>four successes,</strong> the uncoupling releases a massive ionic discharge.

He tries to knock the heroes off the catwalks or into the walls using telekinetic <strong>force powers,</strong> or <strong>damage</strong> them directly. He attempts to disarm opponents of their most powerful weapons and takes out any character who he knows possesses the capability to <strong>damage</strong> his cybernetics.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>If <strong>Draco</strong> is reduced to <strong>0 hit points</strong>, instead is reduced to <strong>1 hitpoint </strong>and he turns to the heroes and says, “<em><strong>You may have defeated me today, but you’ll not win your prize!</strong></em>” Then he turns toward the near-comatose <strong>Master Denia</strong> and hits her with Force lightning. However, <strong>Denia</strong> has one last act left within her; with valiant effort, she reflects the lightning back upon her foe. As the lightning arcs back and forth between the combatants, <strong>Denia</strong> collapses onto the examination table. <strong>Draco,</strong> obviously weakened further, glares at the heroes, then runs or leaps up the ramp to the floors above with the <strong>Force.</strong></p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, it appears that one of the heroes is going to perish in this battle against <strong>Draco, Master Denia</strong> summons one last rush of energy and attacks <strong>Draco</strong> with the <strong>Force.</strong> Reflecting the <strong>Force</strong> energy back at one another, both <strong>Denia</strong> and <strong>Draco</strong> are seriously wounded.

A quick scan reveals that their ship is the only one in the immediate area; <strong>traffic</strong> to and from <strong>Prakith</strong> is <strong>moderate,</strong> with a few construction ships heading in and mining vessels heading out. An automated message arrives from a <strong>hyperspace buoy</strong> nearby; this is not the standard Message to Spacers <strong>(METOSP),</strong> but an abrupt speech dripping with Imperial authority:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>“Attention!

Right now, it is occupied by <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> and four of his associates, all engineers working at the <strong>Imperial Testing Grounds</strong> on the <strong>Outer Moon.</strong> Two are <strong>Incom</strong> subcontractors and two work for <strong>Subpro,</strong> but the important thing is that they’re all engineers, not technicians. They know a good bit about designing starships, but less about flying them— and, quite obviously, not near enough about fixing them.</p>\n<p>Heroes who dock with the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> learn this and more. Only <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> a chirpy, upbeat Duros, has much spaceflight experience, although the heroes realize pretty quickly that whatever is wrong with the ship is over his bald green head—particularly since he’s left his toolkit on <strong>Prakith.</strong> It takes a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong> to get the ship running again in short order.</p>\n<p>If the heroes glance around while they are working on the ship or afterward, they spy one of the engineers working at a console. The console displays a ship design with which the heroes are utterly unfamiliar; it resembles a forced marriage of a large <strong>Z-95 Headhunter</strong> and an <strong>ARC-170</strong>. If the heroes ask <strong>Seejo</strong> about the ship, he begins chattering about a <strong>Deep Scout</strong> design that <strong>Subpro</strong> and <strong>Incom</strong> are jointly developing on the <strong>Outer Moon</strong> of <strong>Prakith</strong>—until one of the other engineers reminds the chatty <strong>Duros</strong> that secret does actually mean secret. “<em><strong>You’re hanging by a thread as it is, Seej.</strong></em>” Blushing—in his case, picking up a slightly bluer hue of green—Jekk coughs and chuckles.</p>\n<p>Receiving a message from his employers, <strong>Jekk</strong> makes his apologies and escorts the heroes to the airlock with their ship. “<em><strong>If you’re ever in Prak City, look me up,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>I do a lot of thinking at the Mother Lode Cantina. Maybe we can talk hyperspace theory sometime—and, um, you can tell me again how you got that thingie back there to do what you got it to do.</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Jekk Seejo</h2>\n<p>As an <strong>Incom</strong> employee, <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> frequently let his enthusiasm for all things spaceworthy get out of hand. Fancying himself an amateur explorer and test pilot but without the training for either, <strong>Seejo</strong> often wheedled his coworkers into using his ship, an old clunker left over from the Clone Wars, as a guinea pig for their more outlandish concepts. By the time of the Empire, with <strong>COMPNOR</strong> beginning to purge aliens from the ranks of major defense firms, <strong>Seejo</strong> was reduced to the role of a subcontractor, finding work only when his friends in the engineering community brought him in.

Ironically, this part of <strong>Prak City</strong> predates the Empire; the plateau made for a good location for mining prospectors to place their encampments. The miners are still there, but so are all the construction firms the Empire has brought in. The firms are actively taking down parts of the old city to put up a new one in its place—a city which, many of the residents in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> realize, they will not be welcome in. Their increasingly ghettoized community is an active part of its own destruction.</p>\n<p>Destruction of brain cells is the major leisure-time activity here, and inquiries will direct the heroes to a shrine devoted to the act: the <strong>Mother Lode Cantina.</strong> Managed by a female Bothan who gets left alone because she knows where all the skeletons are buried on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the <strong>Cantina</strong> is host to a wider range of individuals than would ever be allowed to congregate anywhere else on <strong>Prakith.</strong> There are construction workers and miners here, Human and alien both, with the latter complaining of increasing harassment by <strong>COMPNOR.</strong></p>\n<p>The cantina’s real mother lode is information. Depending on who the heroes talk to, they can learn quite a lot.</p>\n<h3>Construction Workers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Environmental practices here are not particularly sound. The Empire is literally drilling holes in the giant mesa and dumping its construction debris and trash into them.</li>\n<li>Most of the workers who built the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> have been cycled off <strong>Prakith</strong> by their employers—on purpose, most suspect.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Citadel</strong> has entry points at its base and a small landing platform at its top, used by <strong>Inquisitors</strong> going to and returning from <strong>Prak City</strong>.</li>\n<li>Part of why the <strong>Citadel</strong> went up so fast is that they found a clearing in the mountains that was perfectly flat and sound enough for a foundation. Who cleared it, they don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miners</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are four major mining operations in the vicinity of <strong>Prak City</strong>. The <strong>Asonel</strong> system is the largest, with multiple mining operations; it is to the <strong>north</strong> and <strong>northwest.</strong> To the <strong>west</strong> and <strong>southwest</strong> are more modest operations: the <strong>Geddis, Herkeath,</strong> and <strong>Rilkean</strong> mines.</li>\n<li>Gems are the most lucrative resource miners get from <strong>Prakith’s</strong> crust; in some places, they’re plentiful enough to be picked from the cave wall by hand. Of course, someone still must do the work.</li>\n<li>Cave-ins have plagued a lot of mines, making employees for these operations hard to come by. It shouldn’t be too hard for itinerant laborers such as the heroes to sign on with a mining operation. Curiously, at least one, the <strong>Geddis</strong> operation, is looking for hired muscle as well as miners.</li>\n<li>To the knowledge of the miners here, none of the cavern systems entered by the major mining operations interconnect, and none comes anywhere near the Magraddor Range (where the <strong>Citadel</strong> is).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aliens</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are stepping up the pressure on construction and mining firms to get rid of their non-Human employees.</li>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents in <strong>Prak City</strong> itself have recently begun hassling aliens physically, with the Empire turning a blind eye.</li>\n<li>It’s rumored that <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are literally getting away with murder—a lot of <strong>“undesirables”</strong> have been disappearing altogether.</li>\n<li>There might be a native non-Human population on <strong>Prakith.</strong> Unusual characters have been seen from time to time, but they dash away as quickly as they’re spotted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whoever the heroes talk to, they should hear that the best source of information might be the guy who’s been on <strong>Prakith</strong> the longest, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong>. A former miner (and the founder of the Geddis mine), <strong>Geddis</strong> is drinking his life away in the back room. He knows a lot, but heroes are warned that his liver and mind are in equally poor shape these days.</p>\n<h3>Old Man Geddis</h3>\n<p>They call him the <strong>Old Man,</strong> and one look at him shows why: <strong>Myrum Geddis</strong> looks like he’s spent much of his <strong>70 years</strong> either lifting rocks or drilling into them. He probably looked this way at <strong>30.</strong> But swilling his drink at a table in the back, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> gives no impression of having been in a mine—or having engaged in any kind of work—in the past <strong>year.</strong> His days are spent nattering about the phantom creatures he’s seen in the catacombs, and drowning his sorrows. And he has a few: As the heroes can learn by offering <strong>Geddis</strong> a drink or two, the mine that bears his name is no longer his:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is Geddis mine a rich claim? </strong>“<em>You betcha it is—though it’s tougher’n anythin’ to get the gems outta there. You gotta be real careful not to hit ‘em with the laser-borer too much or you’ll ruin the lot. It’s fine work—y’need organics for that.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why couldn’t you make a go of the claim?</strong> “<em>I coulda! But I couldn’t afford to hire all the hands I needed t’really get at the good gem veins. And then them Impies come along, givin’ favors t’the Thaarke Corporation. Blast ‘em all!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s wrong with the Thaarke Corporation?</strong> “<em>They’re scum! Claim-jumpers—and that’s not all. Criminals, the lot of them. And they use slaves when they can find ‘em!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What makes you think there were creatures living underground?</strong> “I<em> seen ‘em! At th’ end of a tunnel—I could barely make ‘em out, but they was movin’. Looked for all my years like hairless Wookiees, if y’ask me.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are they looking for more miners out there?</strong> “<em>Ye’d help them, even after drinkin’ with me? Pfah! But they’ve taken every lowlife that don’t know how t’tell a gem from a dirtball. I guess they’d take ya.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discussion, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> sinks into a drunken stupor. Further inquiries about the <strong>Thaarke Corporation</strong> can be made within the cantina. Most people believe that the firm is a better and more productive steward than <strong>Geddis</strong> was; at least, plenty of gems are coming out now. <strong>Thaarke</strong> is hiring miners and security-types for the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine, and if the heroes are interested, they can visit the recruiting post in the morning. “<em><strong>Just don’t say that Old Man Geddis sent you!</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Seejo Again</h2>\n<p>Emerging from the cantina after dark, the heroes head up the alley and spy something rolling their way—a metal barrel, bounding down the lane. The can crashes against the side of a building, and a familiar yelp emanates from within the barrel. The lid pops off to reveal none other than <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> dizzy and bruised. Regaining his bearings, <strong>Seejo</strong> recognizes the heroes. He’s pleased to see them, but fearful of the half-dozen figures coming down the hill. They’re <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents, devoted to purging non-Human influences from the Empire. “<em><strong>You drunks stand aside,</strong></em>” the first one yells. “<em><strong>This isn’t your affair!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> panicking, seems to think that it is. “<em><strong>Don’t let them have me!</strong></em>” When the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to port, he lost his job, his ship, and, ultimately, any protection he had against <strong>COMPNOR.</strong> They no longer want him on <strong>Prakith,</strong> and he fears that they won’t bother deporting him. The agents were rolling him somewhere when the barrel got away. “<em><strong>They’re going to throw me down the Drains,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>Help me!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>The <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents eye the heroes suspiciously, especially if there are any non-Humans within the group. “Get in our way, will you? Well, you can share what’s coming to the skinbag here!” See the encounter “<strong>Saving Seejo.</strong>”</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[BFBCdysXeUt8VHUz]{9-01 Saving Seejo}</p>\n<p>Down here in the alley after dark, there’s a good chance that a brawl will go unnoticed; the Empire rather expects <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters to start a lot of the fights themselves. Bystanders disappear into the nearby buildings quickly. <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters will quickly try to flee once the player seem to be winning up the stairs on foot, running down a side alley or into the cantina as a last resort. They do not flee to the south, where one of the <strong>Drains</strong> is, fearing that might give an attacker ideas.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes deal with the <strong>guard champions</strong>, they will need to make haste in their departure. Though the government of <strong>Prakith</strong> expects trouble from the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters, they will not take the deaths of <strong>four</strong> <strong>guard champions</strong> lightly. However, the Empire’s response will likely be slow, since the local government expects the <strong>guard champions</strong> to be able to handle themselves and therefore will not have reinforcements nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> nearly in a panic, directs the heroes to a stinking pit near the construction site. This is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> tubes drilled from the <strong>Prak City</strong> plateau into a recess deep underground; the Empire has been using them to dump garbage (and the odd individual who has outlived his usefulness). This is a fine place to dispose of any bodies, and the heroes will become aware of the <strong>Drains</strong> as a possible exit from <strong>Prak City</strong>. This particular tube delivers any bodies (or heroes who chance it) to <strong>Location 1</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.</p>\n<p>If the heroes deliver <strong>Seejo</strong> from the fate he feared, he invites them to his sad excuse for a dwelling. As <strong>Seejo</strong> explains, the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to <strong>Prakith’s</strong> second moon infested with <strong>mynocks</strong>, resulting in his firing and the loss of his ship. His former employers sent him on the next shuttle to <strong>Prakith,</strong> but that was no favor. The Duros explains that the Empire has made it impossible for him to make a living, and now he’s at his wit’s end. If he can’t find employment quickly, he’ll be at the mercy of the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> thugs anywhere he goes on <strong>Prak City</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo</strong> asks about the condition of the heroes’ ship. He begs for the tedious assignment of inspecting their vessel in port over the next <strong>few days</strong>. “<em><strong>Trust me! I’ll have a tool kit this time! I’ll deliver your ship to you, wherever you are!</strong></em>” <strong>Seejo</strong> seems trustworthy enough, and the heroes know that the security system on their ship is such that he wouldn’t be able to activate the hyperdrive. If the players still turn him down, he mention that he know all the Empire's tricks and can make sure they dont plant any bugs, bombs or any other surprises on the player's ship.</p>\n<p>If hired, <strong>Seejo</strong> grows chipper again and gives the heroes his <strong>comlink ID number</strong> before darting off toward the <strong>spaceport.</strong> (The Duros thus provides a possible means of escape later for heroes in the <strong>Citadel</strong>, but if the heroes refuse his help now, they will have other options.)</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Shadowy Figure</h2>\n<p>As another day begins and ends on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the heroes find their continued presence in <strong>Prak City</strong> is meeting with diminishing returns. The military areas are unwelcoming, with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> here and there keeping a watch on this important Imperial asset. Only the miners seem to have any regular access to the area between <strong>Prak City</strong> and the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> There are meager opportunities to defy the Empire in the <strong>Work Zone;</strong> the heroes might succeed at a sabotage attempt on a construction site once, but the area will be saturated with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> thereafter. And reports among the workers say that as more and more of <strong>Prak City</strong> is up and running, <strong>Inquisitor</strong> sweeps of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> are on the increase.</p>\n<p>The heroes always have the feeling that they’re being followed, which is confirmed one night in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> after a successful<strong> DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A shadowy figure darts from cover to cover in the alleys of the <strong>Work Zone,</strong> keeping an eye on the party. But the instant the heroes spot their follower, they realize it’s not an <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> but something else.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Spotted, a tall shadow falls back toward a construction area, diving for a crawlspace underneath a parked crane.

His <strong>Basic</strong> vocabulary is very limited; there’s no telling where he picked it up, but Stereb are great mimics. He’s been lost in <strong>Prak City</strong> for <strong>several days</strong>, and he seems to have come from below. Imperial drilling on the plateau attracted his attention, as a few inquiries reveal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where did you come from?</strong> “<em>From Prakith. From inside, where the vital air and fluids nourish the Worldflesh.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you get stuck here?</strong> “<em>I saw the holes where the parasites were fouling our caverns with their filth. I followed the hidden waters’ flow upward and found a passage to this place. But Prakith was weak, and the footing crumbled.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How long have you been up here in Prak City?</strong> “<em>Since I arrived.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why do you trust us?</strong> “<em>I saw you help the green man against the people who chased me. You are not of them. Perhaps you are of the stone.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there another way to your home? </strong>“<em>The pits they have drilled reach there. But I know what awaits below now.

You will help me reach what I hear them call the Drains.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If asked what cannot be left untended or what waits for him below, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> will mention a single word: <strong>greethka.</strong> But he cannot translate it into any word the heroes understand.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Down the Drains</h2>\n<p>Before the heroes’ conversation can continue, a spotlight shines into the construction site from a ship hovering above. “<em><strong>Halt!</strong></em>” comes the call. “<strong><em>You there! Halt on command of the Inquisitorius!</em>”</strong> The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are on a routine sweep of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> for anything out of the ordinary—just to terrorize the locals and remind them the Empire is in charge—and they’ve also been hearing reports of a strange alien lurking around. For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[r65rhUzYEtxeQFzb]{9-03 Curious Inquisitor}</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> they find a code cylinder on him that assists in the entry to <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius.</strong> Dispatching <strong>Jorad,</strong> his team, or the shuttle brings a response in the form of another “<strong>@JournalEntry[8VNmuO9I48ODoIh0]{9-02 Prak City Security Force}</strong>” encounter, so heroes should quickly move to escape the area. <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> running to the south at the opening of this encounter, encourages the heroes to enter the <strong>Drains</strong> with him before seemingly disappearing. The shuttle can be commandeered, although since it has a tracking device onboard, it will not get far before <strong>TIE fighters</strong> arrive to ground it.</p>\n<p>On closer inspection, the heroes see that this is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> bore-holes drilled at a sharp (<strong>80-degree</strong>) angle far down through the rock. <strong>Herdr’tui’s</strong> distant holler emanates from far below, indicating that he’s slid down quickly and seemingly safely. If the heroes follow him, the tube goes to<strong> Location 2</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{9-04 Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that the heroes do not pursue <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> the cavalry arrive for the Empire in the form of a “<strong>@JournalEntry[8VNmuO9I48ODoIh0]{9-02 Prak City Security Force}</strong>” encounter. Afterward, another one of the <strong>Drains</strong> beckons, going to <strong>Location 3</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{9-04 Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.

A quick scan reveals that their ship is the only one in the immediate area; <strong>traffic</strong> to and from <strong>Prakith</strong> is <strong>moderate,</strong> with a few construction ships heading in and mining vessels heading out. An automated message arrives from a <strong>hyperspace buoy</strong> nearby; this is not the standard Message to Spacers <strong>(METOSP),</strong> but an abrupt speech dripping with Imperial authority:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6;height:89.5714px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:89.5714px\">\n<td style=\"padding:3pt 0.1in;height:89.5714px\">\n<p><em>“Attention!

It takes <strong>three hours </strong>to get to <strong>Prakith</strong> orbit, and along the way only a single vessel, a Mining Guild freighter loaded with ore, passes the heroes, heading out to the hyperspace lanes. <strong>Prakith</strong> might soon become a busy center for the Empire, but it is clearly still a work in progress.</p>\n<p>Just before arriving in <strong>Prakith</strong> orbit, the heroes receive a weak distress call over subspace channels. It fades in and out but is strongest at the closest approach to the Inner Moon. Read the following aloud:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“Um . . . hello?

Heroes who decide to investigate without first contacting <strong>Prak City Control</strong> will receive a sharp radio warning, followed not long afterward by a detachment of<strong> TIE fighters</strong> if the heroes fail to change course, putting a crimp in their mission very early. However, if the heroes mention <strong>Jekk Seejo’s</strong> name to <strong>Prak City Control</strong>, permission is given:</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>“Seejo?

Right now, it is occupied by <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> and four of his associates, all engineers working at the <strong>Imperial Testing Grounds</strong> on the <strong>Outer Moon.</strong> Two are <strong>Incom</strong> subcontractors and two work for <strong>Subpro,</strong> but the important thing is that they’re all engineers, not technicians. They know a good bit about designing starships, but less about flying them— and, quite obviously, not near enough about fixing them.</p>\n<p>Heroes who dock with the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> learn this and more. Only <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> a chirpy, upbeat Duros, has much spaceflight experience, although the heroes realize pretty quickly that whatever is wrong with the ship is over his bald green head—particularly since he’s left his toolkit on <strong>Prakith.</strong> It takes a <strong>DC 20 Intelligence (mechanic's kit) check</strong> to get the ship running again in short order.</p>\n<p>If the heroes glance around while they are working on the ship or afterward, they spy one of the engineers working at a console. The console displays a ship design with which the heroes are utterly unfamiliar; it resembles a forced marriage of a large <strong>Z-95 Headhunter</strong> and an <strong>ARC-170</strong>. If the heroes ask <strong>Seejo</strong> about the ship, he begins chattering about a <strong>Deep Scout</strong> design that <strong>Subpro</strong> and <strong>Incom</strong> are jointly developing on the <strong>Outer Moon</strong> of <strong>Prakith</strong>—until one of the other engineers reminds the chatty <strong>Duros</strong> that secret does actually mean secret. “<em><strong>You’re hanging by a thread as it is, Seej.</strong></em>” Blushing—in his case, picking up a slightly bluer hue of green—Jekk coughs and chuckles.</p>\n<p>Receiving a message from his employers, <strong>Jekk</strong> makes his apologies and escorts the heroes to the airlock with their ship. “<em><strong>If you’re ever in Prak City, look me up,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>I do a lot of thinking at the Mother Lode Cantina. Maybe we can talk hyperspace theory sometime—and, um, you can tell me again how you got that thingie back there to do what you got it to do.</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Jekk Seejo</h2>\n<p>As an <strong>Incom</strong> employee, <strong>Jekk Seejo</strong> frequently let his enthusiasm for all things spaceworthy get out of hand. Fancying himself an amateur explorer and test pilot but without the training for either, <strong>Seejo</strong> often wheedled his coworkers into using his ship, an old clunker left over from the Clone Wars, as a guinea pig for their more outlandish concepts. By the time of the Empire, with <strong>COMPNOR</strong> beginning to purge aliens from the ranks of major defense firms, <strong>Seejo</strong> was reduced to the role of a subcontractor, finding work only when his friends in the engineering community brought him in. His happy manner frequently brings his fellow engineers along for the ride, even against their better judgments.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Prak City</h2>\n<p>Read the following aloud as the heroes enter <strong>Prakith’s</strong> atmosphere and approach <strong>Prak City:</strong></p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>If the Empire were looking for a more forbidding world to exploit, it could hardly have selected a better one than Prakith. A planet of tortured ridges, jagged canyons, and sandy gullies, Prakith could give Utapau and Tatooine a run for their money in the contest for the galaxy’s most desperately bleak world.</em></p>\n<p><em>From the air, you see the rugged Magraddor Range far to the west and, nestled within, the towering obsidian spire of the Citadel Inquisitorius.

Ironically, this part of <strong>Prak City</strong> predates the Empire; the plateau made for a good location for mining prospectors to place their encampments. The miners are still there, but so are all the construction firms the Empire has brought in. The firms are actively taking down parts of the old city to put up a new one in its place—a city which, many of the residents in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> realize, they will not be welcome in. Their increasingly ghettoized community is an active part of its own destruction.</p>\n<p>Destruction of brain cells is the major leisure-time activity here, and inquiries will direct the heroes to a shrine devoted to the act: the <strong>Mother Lode Cantina.</strong> Managed by a female Bothan who gets left alone because she knows where all the skeletons are buried on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the <strong>Cantina</strong> is host to a wider range of individuals than would ever be allowed to congregate anywhere else on <strong>Prakith.</strong> There are construction workers and miners here, Human and alien both, with the latter complaining of increasing harassment by <strong>COMPNOR.</strong></p>\n<p>The cantina’s real mother lode is information. Depending on who the heroes talk to, they can learn quite a lot.</p>\n<h3>Construction Workers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Environmental practices here are not particularly sound. The Empire is literally drilling holes in the giant mesa and dumping its construction debris and trash into them.</li>\n<li>Most of the workers who built the <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius</strong> have been cycled off <strong>Prakith</strong> by their employers—on purpose, most suspect.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Citadel</strong> has entry points at its base and a small landing platform at its top, used by <strong>Inquisitors</strong> going to and returning from <strong>Prak City</strong>.</li>\n<li>Part of why the <strong>Citadel</strong> went up so fast is that they found a clearing in the mountains that was perfectly flat and sound enough for a foundation. Who cleared it, they don’t know.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miners</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>There are four major mining operations in the vicinity of <strong>Prak City</strong>. The <strong>Asonel</strong> system is the largest, with multiple mining operations; it is to the <strong>north</strong> and <strong>northwest.</strong> To the <strong>west</strong> and <strong>southwest</strong> are more modest operations: the <strong>Geddis, Herkeath,</strong> and <strong>Rilkean</strong> mines.</li>\n<li>Gems are the most lucrative resource miners get from <strong>Prakith’s</strong> crust; in some places, they’re plentiful enough to be picked from the cave wall by hand. Of course, someone still must do the work.</li>\n<li>Cave-ins have plagued a lot of mines, making employees for these operations hard to come by. It shouldn’t be too hard for itinerant laborers such as the heroes to sign on with a mining operation. Curiously, at least one, the <strong>Geddis</strong> operation, is looking for hired muscle as well as miners.</li>\n<li>To the knowledge of the miners here, none of the cavern systems entered by the major mining operations interconnect, and none comes anywhere near the Magraddor Range (where the <strong>Citadel</strong> is).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Aliens</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are stepping up the pressure on construction and mining firms to get rid of their non-Human employees.</li>\n<li><strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents in <strong>Prak City</strong> itself have recently begun hassling aliens physically, with the Empire turning a blind eye.</li>\n<li>It’s rumored that <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents are literally getting away with murder—a lot of <strong>“undesirables”</strong> have been disappearing altogether.</li>\n<li>There might be a native non-Human population on <strong>Prakith.</strong> Unusual characters have been seen from time to time, but they dash away as quickly as they’re spotted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whoever the heroes talk to, they should hear that the best source of information might be the guy who’s been on <strong>Prakith</strong> the longest, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong>. A former miner (and the founder of the Geddis mine), <strong>Geddis</strong> is drinking his life away in the back room. He knows a lot, but heroes are warned that his liver and mind are in equally poor shape these days.</p>\n<h3>Old Man Geddis</h3>\n<p>They call him the <strong>Old Man,</strong> and one look at him shows why: <strong>Myrum Geddis</strong> looks like he’s spent much of his <strong>70 years</strong> either lifting rocks or drilling into them. He probably looked this way at <strong>30.</strong> But swilling his drink at a table in the back, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> gives no impression of having been in a mine—or having engaged in any kind of work—in the past <strong>year.</strong> His days are spent nattering about the phantom creatures he’s seen in the catacombs, and drowning his sorrows. And he has a few: As the heroes can learn by offering <strong>Geddis</strong> a drink or two, the mine that bears his name is no longer his:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Is Geddis mine a rich claim? </strong>“<em>You betcha it is—though it’s tougher’n anythin’ to get the gems outta there. You gotta be real careful not to hit ‘em with the laser-borer too much or you’ll ruin the lot. It’s fine work—y’need organics for that.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why couldn’t you make a go of the claim?</strong> “<em>I coulda! But I couldn’t afford to hire all the hands I needed t’really get at the good gem veins. And then them Impies come along, givin’ favors t’the Thaarke Corporation. Blast ‘em all!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What’s wrong with the Thaarke Corporation?</strong> “<em>They’re scum! Claim-jumpers—and that’s not all. Criminals, the lot of them. And they use slaves when they can find ‘em!</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>What makes you think there were creatures living underground?</strong> “I<em> seen ‘em! At th’ end of a tunnel—I could barely make ‘em out, but they was movin’. Looked for all my years like hairless Wookiees, if y’ask me.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Are they looking for more miners out there?</strong> “<em>Ye’d help them, even after drinkin’ with me? Pfah! But they’ve taken every lowlife that don’t know how t’tell a gem from a dirtball. I guess they’d take ya.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the conclusion of the discussion, <strong>Old Man Geddis</strong> sinks into a drunken stupor. Further inquiries about the <strong>Thaarke Corporation</strong> can be made within the cantina. Most people believe that the firm is a better and more productive steward than <strong>Geddis</strong> was; at least, plenty of gems are coming out now. <strong>Thaarke</strong> is hiring miners and security-types for the <strong>Geddis</strong> mine, and if the heroes are interested, they can visit the recruiting post in the morning. “<em><strong>Just don’t say that Old Man Geddis sent you!</strong></em>”</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Seejo Again</h2>\n<p>Emerging from the cantina after dark, the heroes head up the alley and spy something rolling their way—a metal barrel, bounding down the lane. The can crashes against the side of a building, and a familiar yelp emanates from within the barrel. The lid pops off to reveal none other than <strong>Jekk Seejo,</strong> dizzy and bruised. Regaining his bearings, <strong>Seejo</strong> recognizes the heroes. He’s pleased to see them, but fearful of the half-dozen figures coming down the hill. They’re <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents, devoted to purging non-Human influences from the Empire. “<em><strong>You drunks stand aside,</strong></em>” the first one yells. “<em><strong>This isn’t your affair!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> panicking, seems to think that it is. “<em><strong>Don’t let them have me!</strong></em>” When the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to port, he lost his job, his ship, and, ultimately, any protection he had against <strong>COMPNOR.</strong> They no longer want him on <strong>Prakith,</strong> and he fears that they won’t bother deporting him. The agents were rolling him somewhere when the barrel got away. “<em><strong>They’re going to throw me down the Drains,</strong></em>” he says. “<em><strong>Help me!</strong></em>”</p>\n<p>The <strong>COMPNOR</strong> agents eye the heroes suspiciously, especially if there are any non-Humans within the group. “Get in our way, will you? Well, you can share what’s coming to the skinbag here!” See the encounter “<strong>Saving Seejo.</strong>”</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[BFBCdysXeUt8VHUz]{9-01 Saving Seejo}</p>\n<p>Down here in the alley after dark, there’s a good chance that a brawl will go unnoticed; the Empire rather expects <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters to start a lot of the fights themselves. Bystanders disappear into the nearby buildings quickly. <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters will quickly try to flee once the player seem to be winning up the stairs on foot, running down a side alley or into the cantina as a last resort. They do not flee to the south, where one of the <strong>Drains</strong> is, fearing that might give an attacker ideas.</p>\n<p>Once the heroes deal with the <strong>guard champions</strong>, they will need to make haste in their departure. Though the government of <strong>Prakith</strong> expects trouble from the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> supporters, they will not take the deaths of <strong>four</strong> <strong>guard champions</strong> lightly. However, the Empire’s response will likely be slow, since the local government expects the <strong>guard champions</strong> to be able to handle themselves and therefore will not have reinforcements nearby.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo,</strong> nearly in a panic, directs the heroes to a stinking pit near the construction site. This is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> tubes drilled from the <strong>Prak City</strong> plateau into a recess deep underground; the Empire has been using them to dump garbage (and the odd individual who has outlived his usefulness). This is a fine place to dispose of any bodies, and the heroes will become aware of the <strong>Drains</strong> as a possible exit from <strong>Prak City</strong>. This particular tube delivers any bodies (or heroes who chance it) to <strong>Location 1</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.</p>\n<p>If the heroes deliver <strong>Seejo</strong> from the fate he feared, he invites them to his sad excuse for a dwelling. As <strong>Seejo</strong> explains, the <em><strong>Good Feeling</strong></em> returned to <strong>Prakith’s</strong> second moon infested with <strong>mynocks</strong>, resulting in his firing and the loss of his ship. His former employers sent him on the next shuttle to <strong>Prakith,</strong> but that was no favor. The Duros explains that the Empire has made it impossible for him to make a living, and now he’s at his wit’s end. If he can’t find employment quickly, he’ll be at the mercy of the <strong>COMPNOR</strong> thugs anywhere he goes on <strong>Prak City</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Seejo</strong> asks about the condition of the heroes’ ship. He begs for the tedious assignment of inspecting their vessel in port over the next <strong>few days</strong>. “<em><strong>Trust me! I’ll have a tool kit this time! I’ll deliver your ship to you, wherever you are!</strong></em>” <strong>Seejo</strong> seems trustworthy enough, and the heroes know that the security system on their ship is such that he wouldn’t be able to activate the hyperdrive. If the players still turn him down, he mention that he know all the Empire's tricks and can make sure they dont plant any bugs, bombs or any other surprises on the player's ship.</p>\n<p>If hired, <strong>Seejo</strong> grows chipper again and gives the heroes his <strong>comlink ID number</strong> before darting off toward the <strong>spaceport.</strong> (The Duros thus provides a possible means of escape later for heroes in the <strong>Citadel</strong>, but if the heroes refuse his help now, they will have other options.)</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">A Shadowy Figure</h2>\n<p>As another day begins and ends on <strong>Prakith,</strong> the heroes find their continued presence in <strong>Prak City</strong> is meeting with diminishing returns. The military areas are unwelcoming, with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> here and there keeping a watch on this important Imperial asset. Only the miners seem to have any regular access to the area between <strong>Prak City</strong> and the <strong>Magraddor Range.</strong> There are meager opportunities to defy the Empire in the <strong>Work Zone;</strong> the heroes might succeed at a sabotage attempt on a construction site once, but the area will be saturated with <strong>Inquisitors</strong> thereafter. And reports among the workers say that as more and more of <strong>Prak City</strong> is up and running, <strong>Inquisitor</strong> sweeps of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> are on the increase.</p>\n<p>The heroes always have the feeling that they’re being followed, which is confirmed one night in the <strong>Work Zone</strong> after a successful<strong> DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check</strong>. A shadowy figure darts from cover to cover in the alleys of the <strong>Work Zone,</strong> keeping an eye on the party. But the instant the heroes spot their follower, they realize it’s not an <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> but something else.</p>\n<table class=\"MsoNormalTable\" style=\"width:523.95pt;background-color:#f8cac6\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding:3.0pt .1in 3.0pt .1in\">\n<p><em>Spotted, a tall shadow falls back toward a construction area, diving for a crawlspace underneath a parked crane.

His <strong>Basic</strong> vocabulary is very limited; there’s no telling where he picked it up, but Stereb are great mimics. He’s been lost in <strong>Prak City</strong> for <strong>several days</strong>, and he seems to have come from below. Imperial drilling on the plateau attracted his attention, as a few inquiries reveal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Where did you come from?</strong> “<em>From Prakith. From inside, where the vital air and fluids nourish the Worldflesh.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How did you get stuck here?</strong> “<em>I saw the holes where the parasites were fouling our caverns with their filth. I followed the hidden waters’ flow upward and found a passage to this place. But Prakith was weak, and the footing crumbled.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>How long have you been up here in Prak City?</strong> “<em>Since I arrived.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why do you trust us?</strong> “<em>I saw you help the green man against the people who chased me. You are not of them. Perhaps you are of the stone.</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Is there another way to your home? </strong>“<em>The pits they have drilled reach there. But I know what awaits below now. I fear to go alone. But with you, perhaps . . .</em>”</li>\n<li><strong>Why are you hiding here?</strong> “<em>I want to go home, to return before it is too late. You cannot leave them untended. You will help me reach what I hear them call the Drains.</em>”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If asked what cannot be left untended or what waits for him below, <strong>Herdr’tui</strong> will mention a single word: <strong>greethka.</strong> But he cannot translate it into any word the heroes understand.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Down the Drains</h2>\n<p>Before the heroes’ conversation can continue, a spotlight shines into the construction site from a ship hovering above. “<em><strong>Halt!</strong></em>” comes the call. “<strong><em>You there! Halt on command of the Inquisitorius!</em>”</strong> The <strong>Inquisitors</strong> are on a routine sweep of the <strong>Work Zone</strong> for anything out of the ordinary—just to terrorize the locals and remind them the Empire is in charge—and they’ve also been hearing reports of a strange alien lurking around. For details on the encounter, see:</p>\n<p>@JournalEntry[r65rhUzYEtxeQFzb]{9-03 Curious Inquisitor}</p>\n<p>If the heroes defeat the <strong>Inquisitor,</strong> they find a code cylinder on him that assists in the entry to <strong>Citadel Inquisitorius.</strong> Dispatching <strong>Jorad,</strong> his team, or the shuttle brings a response in the form of another “<strong>@JournalEntry[8VNmuO9I48ODoIh0]{9-02 Prak City Security Force}</strong>” encounter, so heroes should quickly move to escape the area. <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> running to the south at the opening of this encounter, encourages the heroes to enter the <strong>Drains</strong> with him before seemingly disappearing. The shuttle can be commandeered, although since it has a tracking device onboard, it will not get far before <strong>TIE fighters</strong> arrive to ground it.</p>\n<p>On closer inspection, the heroes see that this is one of the <strong>Drains,</strong> bore-holes drilled at a sharp (<strong>80-degree</strong>) angle far down through the rock. <strong>Herdr’tui’s</strong> distant holler emanates from far below, indicating that he’s slid down quickly and seemingly safely. If the heroes follow him, the tube goes to<strong> Location 2</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{9-04 Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that the heroes do not pursue <strong>Herdr’tui,</strong> the cavalry arrive for the Empire in the form of a “<strong>@JournalEntry[8VNmuO9I48ODoIh0]{9-02 Prak City Security Force}</strong>” encounter. Afterward, another one of the <strong>Drains</strong> beckons, going to <strong>Location 3</strong> in the “<strong>@JournalEntry[OdKRAzW7rij05CWh]{9-04 Devourer in the Dark}</strong>” encounter.
